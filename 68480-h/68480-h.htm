<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
THE HERMIT OF KILMARA.
</h3>

<p>
There was something in the reply given by
young Creggan M'Vayne to Elliott Nugent,
Esq., that this gentleman did not altogether
relish.  He could not have complained of
any want of respect in the boy's utterance or in his
manner, but there was an air of independence about
the lad that jarred against his feelings, and made him
a trifle cross&mdash;for the time being, that is.
</p>

<p>
For Nugent was a great man,&mdash;in his own country
at all events.  He was an ex-secretary from one of the
Colonies, and at home in Australia he had been like
the centurion we read of in the New Testament, and
had had many men under him to whom he could say
"Do this" with the certainty of finding it done, for in
his own great office his word had been law.
</p>

<p>
But here stood this kilted ghillie with his collie dog
by his side&mdash;stay, though, till I present my young hero
to you, reader.  You will then know a little more of
the merits of the case.
</p>

<p>
Than young Creggan M'Vayne, then, no boy was
better known on land or at sea, all along the wild
rocky shores that stretch from Loch Snizort to the
very northernmost cape of Skye, well-named in the
Gaelic "The Island of Wings".  At any time of the
day or by moonlight his little skiff of a boat might be
met by sturdy fishermen speeding over the waves of
the blue Minch, or lazily floating in some
rock-guarded bay, while its solitary occupant lured from
the dark, deep water many a silvery dancing fish.
But inland, too, he was well-known, on lonely moor
and on mountain brow.
</p>

<p>
And Creggan was welcome wherever he went.
Welcome when he appeared at the doors of the rude
huts that were huddled along the sea-shore, welcome
in the shepherd's shieling far away on the hills, and
welcome even at the firesides of gamekeepers themselves.
</p>

<p>
Up to the present time, at all events, Creggan's life
had been a half-wild one, to say the least of it.
Though tall for his years, which barely numbered
fourteen, he was as strong and well-knit as the
sinewy deer of the mountains.  Good-looking he
certainly was, with a depth of chin that pronounced
him more English than Scotch; the bluest of eyes,
a sun-kissed face, and fair, curly hair of so
self-assertive a nature that Creggan's Highland bonnet
never by any chance got within three inches of his
brow.
</p>

<p>
From that same bonnet, then, down to his boots,
or rather brogues, the lad looked every inch a
gentleman.  He was just a trifle shy in presence of his
elders and those who moved in a superior walk of
life to him; but every really good honest-hearted lad
is so.  Among the peasantry, however, he was always
his own manly self.
</p>

<p>
There was one thing concerning Creggan's wild
life that he did not care for anyone to know, not
even his best friend, M'Ian the minister.  And it was
this: he was kind to the very poor.  The fact is, that
the lad was always either in pursuit of game, as he
chose to call even rabbits, or fishing from his skiff or
from the rocks, so that he had generally more than
sufficed for his own needs and those of his guardian,
whom I shall presently introduce to you.  So when
he appeared at the door of widow M'Donald, M'Leod,
or M'Rae, as the case might be&mdash;for they were nearly
all Macs thereabout,&mdash;you couldn't have guessed that
he was carrying a beautiful string of codling or a
"sonsy" rabbit, so carefully was it concealed in his
well-worn and somewhat tattered plaid.
</p>

<p>
I am quite sure that Creggan's faithful collie, whose
name was Oscar, quite approved of what his master
did; he always looked so pleased, and sometimes even
barked for joy, when Creggan presented those welcome
gifts, and while the recipients called blessings down
from heaven on the boy's curly head.
</p>

<p>
But not only did the poorest among the crofters, or
squatters as they might have been called, love the
winsome, happy-visaged boy, but many of them
looked upon him with a strange mixture of superstition
and awe.  He was supposed to bear a kind of
charmed life, because a mystery hung over his advent
which might never, never be cleared up.  For Creggan
was an ocean-child in the truest sense of the word.
When a mere infant he had been found in a small
boat which was stranded on the rock-bound Isle of
Kilmara, off the shores of Skye, one morning after a
gale of wind.  In this islet, which indeed is but little
more than a sea-girt rock, he had dwelt for many
years with the strange being who had picked him up
half-frozen, and had wooed him back to life, and
became not only a father to him but a tutor as well.
</p>

<p>
A strange being indeed was old Tomnahurich, the
Hermit of Kilmara, the name by which he was
generally known.  Only old people could remember his
coming to and taking possession of the island, which
probably belonged to no one in particular, although in
summer-time a few sheep used to be sent to crop the
scanty herbage that grew thereon.  But one beautiful
spring morning,&mdash;with snow-white cloudlets in the
blue sky, and a light breeze rippling the Minch, till
from the mainland of Skye it looked like some mighty
river rolling onwards and north 'twixt the Outer and
Inner Hebrides,&mdash;some fisher-lads on landing were
confronted by a tall, brown-bearded stranger, dressed in
seaman's clothes, and with a cast of countenance and
bearing that showed he was every inch a sailor.  He
had come out from a cave, and into this, with smiles
and nods and talking in the purest of Gaelic, he had
invited the young fellows.  They found a fire burning
here, and fish boiling; there was a rude bench, several
stools, and various articles of culinary utility, to say
nothing of a row of brown stone bottles, the contents
of one of which he begged them to taste.
</p>

<p>
But where the hermit had come from, or how or
why he had come, nobody could tell, and he never
even referred to his own history.
</p>

<p>
He had ceased to dwell in the cave after a time,
and with wood from a shipwrecked barque he had
built himself, in a sheltered corner, a most substantial
though very uncouth kind of a dwelling-hut.  As the
time went on, silver threads had begun to appear in
the brown of the hermit's beard; and now it was
nearly white.  He was apparently as strong and
sturdy as ever, notwithstanding the wintryness of
his hair, and the boy loved his strange guardian
far more than any friend he had, and was never so
happy anywhere as at the rude fireside of his island
home.
</p>

<p>
We never think of what Fate may have in store
for us, especially when we are young, nor at what
particular date fortune's tide may be going to flow
for us.
</p>

<p>
This morning, for instance, when Creggan came on
shore with Oscar, he had no idea that anything
particular was going to happen.  He had first and foremost
drawn up his little boat&mdash;the very skiff it was in
which he had been cradled on the billowy ocean,&mdash;then
gone straight away up to the manse.  Here he
was a great favourite, and M'Ian, the kind-hearted
minister, had for years been his teacher, educating the
boy with his own two children, Rory and Maggie, both
his juniors.
</p>

<p>
I am not going to say that Creggan was more clever
than children of his age usually are, but as the
instruction he received was given gratuitously or for
love, he felt it to be his bounden duty to learn all he
could so as to gratify his teacher.
</p>

<p>
His English was therefore exceptionally good
already, and he had made good progress in geography,
history, arithmetic, and knew the first two books of
Euclid; and he could even prattle in French, which
he had learned from the hermit.  It was usual for
Creggan to spend an hour or two playing with Rory
and little winsome Maggie, after lessons, but to-day
they were going with their father to the distant
town of Portree, so, after bidding them good-bye he
shouldered his little gun, a gift from M'Ian, and,
whistling for Oscar, went off to the cairns to find
a rabbit or two.
</p>

<p>
The cairns where the rabbits dwelt were small
rounded hills about a quarter of a mile inland from
the wild cliffs that frowned over the deep, dark sea.
These knolls were everywhere covered with stones, and
hundreds of wild rabbits played about among these.
But no sooner had Creggan shot just one than the rest
disappeared into their burrows as if by magic.  The
boy had plenty of patience, however, so he simply lay
down and began to read.  Not to study, though.  His
school-books he had left in the graveyard on an old
tombstone, and near to the last resting-place of the
romantic Flora M'Donald, the lady who had saved the
unfortunate Prince Charlie Stuart.
</p>

<p>
After half an hour he secured two more rabbits, and
as the sun began to wester, he strolled slowly
backwards towards the spot where he had beached his
boat, with no intention, however, of putting out to sea
for some little time.
</p>

<p>
With the exception of his school-books poor Creggan's
library was wonderfully small, and his literature
was nearly always borrowed or given to him.  For
instance, even in the most squalid huts he had often
found books that gave him no end of pleasure.  They
were mostly in the grand old Gaelic; but Creggan
could read the language well, and in the long dark
forenights of winter he used to delight the old hermit
by trotting out the mysterious and Homeric-like lines
of Ossian's poems.  Then tourists, to whom he acted
in the capacity of guide in summer-time, sometimes
gave him a book, and M'Ian's library was always at
his service.
</p>

<p>
So to-day he had thrown himself on his face on the
green cliff-top, and had commenced to read his Ossian.
</p>

<p>
What a glorious summer afternoon!  There was
the blue Minch asleep in the sunshine, and stretching
away and away far over to the hazy hills of Harris
and Lewis.  White gulls were floating on its billows
close inshore, or wheeling high in air around the
stupendous cliffs, where their nests were,&mdash;their plaintive,
melancholy notes mingling with the song of the lark,
the mavis, and the merle, while the solemn boom of
the breaking waves made a sweet but awful diapason.
</p>

<p>
The air all around was warm and balmy, and laden
with the sweet breath of wild thyme.
</p>

<p>
And Creggan M'Vayne was just reading one of his
favourite, because most romantic passages, when the dry
and business-like tones of Elliott Nugent fell upon his
ear.  Beautiful, indeed, did the boy consider every
line of that wild and weird poem <i>Carric-Thura</i>.  The
ghost scene therein made him shudder; but it was the
death of the lovers on the field of battle&mdash;the death of
Connal and Crimora that affected him most.  She had
given him his arms with sad and woesome foreboding,
but at the same time had determined to follow him
into the fight.
</p>

<p>
<i>Here was the din of arms; here the groans of the
dying.  Bloody are the wars of Fingal, O Connal, and
it was here thou didst fall!  Thine arm was like a
storm; thy sword a beam of the sky; thy height a
rock upon the plain; thine eyes a furnace of fire.
Warriors fell by thy sword as the thistles by the staff
of a boy.  Then Dargo the mighty came on, darkening
in his wrath.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Bright rose their swords on each side; loud was the
clang of their steel.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>But Crimora was near, bright in the armour of
man.  Her yellow hair is loose behind, her bow is
in her hand.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>She drew the string on Dargo; but&mdash;erring&mdash;she
pierced her Connal.  He falls like an oak on the plain;
like a rock from the shaggy hill.  What now can she
do, O hapless maiden?  See how he bleeds, her Connal
dies!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>All night long she weeps and all the livelong day.
O Connal, O Connal, my love and my friend!</i>
</p>

<p>
But with grief the maiden dies, and in the same
grave they sleep.  Undisturbed they now sleep
together; in the tomb on the mountain they rest alone,
and the wind sighs through the long green grass that
grows twixt the stones of the grave.
</p>

<p>
<i>Autumn is dark on the mountains; gray mists rest
on the hills.  Dark rolls the river through the narrow
plain.  A tree stands alone on the hill and marks the
slumbering Connal.  The leaves whirl round in the
wind and strew the grave of the dead.  Soft be their
rest, hapless children of streamy Loda.</i>
</p>

<p>
Here Creggan had closed the book with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Boy, are you willing to earn an honest shilling?
Keep back that dog, please!"
</p>

<p>
The boy had sprung to his feet and seized the
all-too-impetuous Oscar by the collar.
</p>

<p>
Nugent's appearance was somewhat out of keeping
with the grandeur of the scenery around him.  Thin
and wan he was, with close-trimmed whiskers turning
to gray, a London coat, and a soft felt hat.
</p>

<p>
"Earn a shilling, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I said earn a shilling, an honest shilling.  But
perhaps you are above that sort of thing.  You Skye
Highlanders are, as a rule, so lazy."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir, but I am not a Skyeman, though
I should not be ashamed to be.  I was born on the
high seas, and I have neither mother nor father."
</p>

<p>
Nugent's voice softened at once.  His whole bearing
was altered.
</p>

<p>
"Poor boy!" he said.  "I fear I talked harshly.
But come, we were directed here by an old man who
told us you could guide us over the mountains
inland.  My wife is an artist, and wants to make
a sketch or two.  See, yonder she comes, and my little
daughter, Matty.  Come, you seem to be a superior
sort of lad, you shall have half a crown."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want your money.  I sha'n't touch it.  But
if you wait a few minutes I will guide you to a
strange land far away among the hills.  There will
just be time to return before sunset."
</p>

<p>
"And you will take no reward?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, sir, I will.  I love books.  I would have
a book if you could lend it to me."
</p>

<p>
"That we will, with pleasure.  I have a boy just
about your age&mdash;sixteen, and he lives in books.  You
are a little over sixteen, perhaps?"
</p>

<p>
Creggan smiled.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," he replied, taking off his bonnet now, for
Mrs. Nugent and Matty had come up; "I want some
months of fourteen."
</p>

<p>
"You are a very beautiful Highland boy," said
Matty, gazing up at Creggan with innocent admiration;
"and if you is good, mamma will paint you."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, dear, hush!" cried the stately mother.
</p>

<p>
Creggan looked at the child.  He had never seen
anyone so lovely before, not even in Portree.  But
there was a little green knoll high up in a glen that
he knew of, on which, as the old people told him,
fairies danced and played in the moonlight.  He had
never seen any of these, though many times and oft
he had watched for them.  But he thought now that
Matty must just be like one.
</p>

<p>
I must confess that there was a small hole in each
of the elbows of Creggan's tweed jacket, but
nevertheless when he stepped right up, as if moved by some
sudden impulse and shook Matty's tiny hand, his
bearing was in keeping with the action, and even
Nugent himself admitted afterwards that he looked
a perfect little gentleman.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you were my sister."
</p>

<p>
That is all he said.
</p>

<p>
But for the next few minutes very busy was
Creggan indeed.
</p>

<p>
First and foremost he made a flag of his handkerchief
and hoisted it on the end of his gun.  This
he waved in the air, until presently an answering
signal could be seen on the distant island.
</p>

<p>
Then to right and to left, alow and aloft, he made
signals with the flag, much to the delight of little
blue-eyed Matty, ending all by holding his gun
perpendicularly and high in air, after which he turned to
his new acquaintances.
</p>

<p>
"I'm quite ready," he said.
</p>

<p>
The march towards the mountains was now commenced.
But the road led past the manse, and thither
ran Creggan, returning almost immediately with a tiny
Shetland pony.  This consequential little fellow was
fully caparisoned, with not only a child's saddle but
saddle-bags.  Into the latter Mrs. Nugent's sketching-gear
was put, and then Creggan picked Matty up
and placed her on the saddle.  Oscar barked, and
the child screamed with joy, as off they headed for
the wild mountains.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
High above the blue-gray hills of Harris lay streak
on streak of carmine clouds, with saffron all between,
as Creggan's skiff went dancing over the waves that
evening, towards his little island home.  But the boy
saw them not, saw nothing in fact till his boat's keel
rasped upon the beach, where his foster-father stood,
ready to haul her up.
</p>

<p>
For Creggan's thoughts were all with his newly-found
friends and the doings of this eventful day.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
THE NIGHT CAME ON BEFORE ITS TIME.
</h3>

<p>
The home of Hermit M'Vayne, which was Creggan's
foster-father's real name, was indeed a strange
one.  Situated under the south-western side of a rock,
partly leaning against it, in fact, stood the strong and
sturdy hut.  The sides, and even the roof, were of
timber, the latter thatched with heather and grass;
though only one gable was of stone, and here was the
chimney that conducted the smoke from the low
hearth upwards and outwards to the sky.
</p>

<p>
And night and day around this log-house moaned
the wind, for even when almost calm on the mainland
a breeze was blowing here, and ever and aye on the
dark cliff-foot beneath broke and boomed the waves
of the restless Minch.  But when the storm-king rose
in his wrath and went shrieking across the bleak
island, the spray from the breakers was dashed high
and white, far over the hut, and would have found
its way down the chimney itself had this not been
protected by a moving cowl.
</p>

<p>
But I really think that the higher the wind blew,
and the louder it howled, while the waves sullenly
boomed and thundered on the rocks below, the cosier
and happier did the hermit and his foster-child feel
within.
</p>

<p>
Although, strangely enough, the hermit had never
as yet told Creggan the story of his own past life, nor
his reasons for settling down on this sea-girdled little
morsel of rock and moorland, still he never seemed to
tire of telling the boy about his adventures on many
lands and many seas, nor did the lad ever weary
of listening to these.  And the wilder they were the
better he liked them.
</p>

<p>
It was on stormy nights, especially in winter, that
Creggan's strange foster-father became most communicative.
But on such nights, before even the frugal supper
was placed upon the board, the hermit felt he had
a duty to perform, and he never neglected it.  For high
on a rock on the centre of the island he had erected
a little hollow tower of stone.  It was in reality
a kind of slow-combustion stove filled with peats and
chunks of wood, and with pieces of sea-weed over all.
It was lit from below, and when the wind blew
through the chinks and crannies, it sent forth a glare
that could be seen far and high over the storm-tossed
ocean.  Many a brave brig or barque staggering up
the Minch, and many a fisherman's boat also, on dark
and windy nights had to thank the hermit's beacon-light
that warned them off the Whaleback rocks.
</p>

<p>
Having set fire to his storm-signal, the old man's
work was done for the day.  Supper finished, a
chapter from the Book of Books was read, then a prayer
was prayed&mdash;not read from a printed book,&mdash;and after
this the inmates of this rude but cosy hut drew their
stools more closely to the fire.  No light was lit if not
needed, and indeed it was seldom necessary, the
blazing peats and the crackling logs gave forth a glare
that, though fitful, was far more pleasant to talk by
than any lamp could have been.
</p>

<p>
Now, Mr. Nugent and his wife had promised to visit
Creggan some evening on his lonely island, and not
only Matty but her brother also were to accompany
them.  They did not say when the visit would be
made.  Their lives were as unlike Creggan's as one
could possibly imagine.  They were spending the
summer here in Skye, living in a rough sort of a
shanty, which, however, they had furnished themselves
and made exceedingly comfortable; and every
day brought them some new pleasure: boating parties,
long journeys over the mountains, painting, botanizing,
or collecting specimens and even fossils, for on no
island in all our possessions, does nature display her
stores on a more liberal scale than in this same wildly
romantic Skye.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon's outing for which they were indebted
to young Creggan Ogg M'Vayne had been pronounced
delightful beyond compare.  It was indeed a strange
land they had reached at last, pastoral and poetic as
well.  Bonnie green valleys, watered by many a rippling
burn, and little waterfalls that came trickling
down from the rocks, and studded over with lazy,
well-fed cattle and a few sheep.  There were but two
huts here, near-by the banks of a little stream, that
went singing onwards till its brown waters were
swallowed up in a small lake, the surface of which
was everywhere wrinkled by sportive trout, leaping
high to catch gnats or midges even in the air.
</p>

<p>
The Nugents were surprised, but charmed to find
that the tiny encampment was inhabited only by
sturdy bare-footed, bare-headed lassies, who were here
to tend the cows, and to make butter and cheese, which
would afterwards be sold at the distant market town
of Portree.
</p>

<p>
Creggan had to be interpreter, for never a word of
English had these girls to bless themselves in.
</p>

<p>
And Mrs. Nugent stayed long enough to make
several delightful sketches in water-colours, over
which the lassies went into raptures.  The clouds in
the blue sky, the distant peeps of ocean, with here and
there a little sail, the darkling rocks, the mountain
peaks, and nearer still in the foreground, the foaming
linns, the green braes, and the beautiful cows, with
their attendants, all came out on the paper by the
magic touch of the artist's brush.
</p>

<p>
Long before they had once more reached the cliffs by
the sea that night, Matty and Creggan seemed to have
established a friendship as frank and free as if they
had known each other for many and many a year.
Then good-byes had been said, and the promise given
by Mr. Nugent to come out to the island some afternoon,
or to take it in their way home from the far-off
island of Harris.  But a fortnight passed by and they
had not yet appeared.  Nor, although he thought about
them, and especially about Matty, times without
number, had Creggan seen them even at a distance.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, the boy in his skiff returned home
much sooner than usual.
</p>

<p>
It is not in winter only that wild storms sweep up
or down or across the Minch, for even in summer, and
suddenly too, gales arise, and while, as far as eye can
see, the Atlantic is one wide chaos of broken and
foaming water, the cliffs and hills seem shaken to
their rude foundations by wind and wave.  Yet
speedily as such tempests come, there are generally
indications beforehand that tell the fishermen abroad
in their open boats that they must run quickly for
the nearest shelter, if dear life itself is to be saved.
</p>

<p>
"Right glad to see you, lad," said the hermit, as he
helped Creggan to secure his boat high and dry behind
a rock, where, blow as it might, nothing could damage
her.
</p>

<p>
"You think it is going to blow, Daddy?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, sonny, that it is.  Night will come on, too,
long hours before its time.  Ah, boy, we'll have
to pray for those at sea to-night!  I hope your friends
will not think of leaving Lewis."
</p>

<p>
"You have seen them, father?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, boy, aye.  They passed the island almost
within hail of me, in a half-deck boat, which I think
must have been hired at Portree."
</p>

<p>
"And was little Matty there?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, lad, and her father and mother, and a boy
older than you&mdash;though not so brave-looking."
</p>

<p>
The old hermit put his hand fondly on young
Creggan's curly head as he spoke.  No father could
have been fonder of a son than was he of this
motherless bairn.
</p>

<p>
"But, dear boy, you haven't come empty-handed, I
see."
</p>

<p>
"No; I never had a better forenoon among the trout.
Look!"
</p>

<p>
From under a thwart of the boat forward, Creggan
lugged forth and held up for admiration, a string
of crimson-spotted mountain trout that would have
caused many a Cockney sportsman to bite his lips
with envy.
</p>

<p>
The old man smiled, patted the boy once again, then
hand in hand&mdash;such was their habit&mdash;they took their
way along the winding path which led to the hut.
</p>

<p>
Oscar had been at home all day, but he now came
bounding out with many a joyous bark, to welcome
his master back.  More quietly, too, though none the
less sincerely did Gilbert, a huge, red tabby cat, bid
the boy welcome, rubbing his great head against Creggan's
stocking and purring loudly, while from the inner
recesses of the hut a voice could be heard shouting:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Come in, Creggan!  Come in, come in!</i>"
</p>

<p>
It was the voice of no human being, however, but
that of a beautiful gray parrot, who had been the
hermit's companion since ever he had taken up his
residence on this little isle of the ocean.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon wore away quickly enough, as afternoons
always do when one is busy.  And Creggan had
hooks to busk, and his foster-father was busy
mending nets.
</p>

<p>
But the sun set at last, in lurid fiery clouds, over
the hills of Harris, and soon after those very clouds,
dark and threatening now, began to bank up and roll
forward over the sea, on the wings of a moaning wind,
shortening the twilight and obscuring the rising stars
that had already begun to twinkle in the east.
</p>

<p>
The beacon had not been lit for many weeks, but
to-night the hermit seemed to take extra pains with it,
and as soon as the shadows of night fell over the sea
its red glimmer shone far over the darkling waves, on
which already white horses had begun to appear.
</p>

<p>
Bleak and cold blew the wind, too, for in these
northern climes summer is not always the synonym for
warmth of weather.
</p>

<p>
But supper and prayers over, the two Crusoes, as
we well might term them, drew closer round the fire.
Even Polly asserted her right to join the circle.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Poor Polly!</i>" she cried; "<i>poor dear old, old Polly!
Polly wants to come!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Then Creggan carried her cage forward and placed
it in a corner, where the firelight might dance and
flicker on it.  Collie curled up in front of the fire,
and close beside him Gibbie the cat sat down.  And
before seating himself near to his foster-father's big
easy-chair, the boy handed him his pipe, and not that
alone, but a fine old fiddle that he took from a green
baize bag which hung upon the wall.
</p>

<p>
"And now," said Creggan; "now, dear Daddy, I feel
just very happy, but I'm not quite sure yet what I
shall make you do.  You shall sing, anyhow, over the
fiddle, some fine old sea-song, father, that will bring
right up before me all the romance of your early days,
just as this little book of Ossian's poems makes me
think I am living in the olden times, and can hear the
clang and crash of battle, or the sweet notes of harps
sounding low and sweet in halls by the stormy sea."
</p>

<p>
"Verily, boy, you are a poet yourself.  Ah, lad, when
you enter life all will be stern reality!"
</p>

<p>
"I never want to enter life, Daddy dear; I want
always, always to be here with you on our own little
island home.  But listen, Daddy, was that not a scream?
There again?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, boy, nay, it is but the cry of some storm-frightened
night-bird rising shrill and high over the
wail of the wind and dash of the waves.  Yet may
Heaven in its mercy protect any craft on a lee shore
to-night!"
</p>

<p>
But Creggan felt uneasy, and for quite a long time
he sat in silence, while the hermit, gazing quietly into
the blazing fire as he smoked, seemed to recall many a
strange event in his former life.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Creggan sprang up.  He had keen ears.
The dog ran towards the door at the same time, barking
aloud.
</p>

<p>
For adown the wind, twice repeated, had floated the
sharp sound of a rifle or gun.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Daddy," cried Creggan, now pale with agitation,
"some ship or boat is on the Whaleback rocks out
yonder!  That was a signal of distress."
</p>

<p>
"Then, boy, we must give all the assistance in our
power, and if in doing so we die, we shall die doing
our duty.  Light the great hurricane-lamp.  Keep
calm, lad; while there is life there is hope."
</p>

<p>
Next minute both stood together on the edge of
the cliff that pointed nor'ard and west, while behind
them on a pole was fixed the hurricane-lamp.
</p>

<p>
What a wild turmoil of a sea was down below.
As each white wave dashed against the beetling rocks,
high upwards almost to their feet rose the singing
seething water.  But at present the sky was not
wholly overcast.  There were rifts among the
scudding, hurrying clouds, and now and then the moon
shone through.
</p>

<p>
"Look!  look!" cried Creggan.  "Can you see it,
Daddy?  High and dark on Lorna's rock!  The boat,
the boat, with the waves sweeping past and over it!"
</p>

<p>
The hermit passed his hand across his brow and
eyes, and strained forward to gaze into the darkness.
</p>

<p>
Just then the moon cast a pale glimmer across the
waves, and every line of the stranded boat stood
darkling out against a background of white and
stormy water.
</p>

<p>
The old man shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven be near to help us, boy," he cried, "but
yonder is the Nugents' boat!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
THE STORM.
</h3>

<p>
Never would I dare to detract from the glory and
honour that hangs, halo-like, around the memory
of one of our nation's heroines&mdash;poor Grace Darling;
but there are deeds done along the shores of this land
of ours every winter, ay, and every summer too, that,
although they shine not in story, are as bravely
undertaken and as courageously carried out as that
rescue at the Longstone lighthouse.
</p>

<p>
Though the hermit was white as to hair, though
his beard flowed backwards now in the breeze like
a silver stream as he stood in the glare of the
hurricane-lamp, he was not an aged man.  Every
limb was straight, every muscle was strong, and
his lowered brows nearly hid eyes that burned like
living coals as he stood there on the cliff-top, pointing
towards the doomed and stranded boat.
</p>

<p>
"Creggan, my lad," he cried, "we may not be able
to save a single life, but our duty lies plain before
us&mdash;we shall try!"
</p>

<p>
He unfastened the lamp and swung it to and fro
for a spell, as if to give heart to those on board,
then hastened with it down to the beach, closely
followed by Creggan.
</p>

<p>
Not only was there here, in a little rock-bound cove,
Creggan's own skiff, but one of far broader beam, one
with a sturdy keel, and encircled as to its outside
with a great and thick band of cork.  The old man
called it his lifeboat, and it had done duty more than
once before, but never perhaps on so wild and stormy
a night as this.
</p>

<p>
It was quickly launched now, and, being to the
manner born, Creggan seized the tiller and the hermit
took the oars.
</p>

<p>
Every rock around the islet was well-known to
both.  The lamp was hung aloft on a morsel of mast
that was stepped near to the fore thwart, and cast its
red glare on the seas ahead as well as on the faces of
these daring heroes.
</p>

<p>
Once beyond the protection of the black jutting
rocks, it was all that M'Vayne could do&mdash;strong
though his arms were&mdash;to keep the boat from
broaching-to, but soon he got weigh on her and
then the rudder told.
</p>

<p>
But how the wind howled, and how the seething,
angry waves dashed over them!  Sometimes the bows
were tossed clean out of the water, and it seemed for
a second or two that she would go down stem first
into the trough of the sea; and as that wave went
racing past her, down dashed the bows again with
a slapping sound that could be heard high over the
roar of the wind.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br />
CREGGAN KEPT THE BOAT HEAD-ON TO EACH THREATENING WAVE
</p>

<p>
Not a word was spoken.  Not a word could have
been heard in the turmoil, unless it were shrieked.
Yet Creggan knew enough to keep her head on to
each advancing, threatening wave.  Neither the fury
of the tempest nor the anger of the curling waves
frightened him.  He felt in that state of exultation
which danger never fails to raise in the hearts of
the truly brave, and beside which fear finds no
place.
</p>

<p>
So sturdily did the hermit row, that in less than
twenty minutes' time&mdash;and this did not seem
long&mdash;the boat was well to windward of the stranded
craft.
</p>

<p>
The danger now was great.  To bear down on the
wave-tops and get alongside seemed almost a hopeless
task.
</p>

<p>
But although she shipped some water she came
bravely round, and went heading inland now, like
a bird adrift on the ocean tide.
</p>

<p>
The Skyemen on board the stranded craft saw her,
and did not require to be told to throw a rope.  Next
minute it seemed&mdash;so quickly did the minutes fly&mdash;that
the tiny lifeboat was alongside and fast.
</p>

<p>
"Quick now!" shouted the hermit.  "Lower down
the ladies and the boy.  We can only manage three.
Bear a hand, my lads.  Bear a hand!"
</p>

<p>
It seemed in answer to the hermit's prayers that at
this moment a lull in the storm took place, and the
moon shone out bright and clear over the tempestuous
sea.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the labour of getting the trembling
lady and frightened little Matty on board was most
dangerous, and had to be undertaken with the greatest
caution.
</p>

<p>
Nugent shouted to his son Willie to go next, but
the brave boy positively refused to get over the side
until the boat returned from the shore when his father
had landed.  His father must go first, he said.
</p>

<p>
She did return, and then took off young Nugent
and two seamen, all she could stow away with safety.
There was but one man left in the lugger now.
</p>

<p>
Alas, for his fate!
</p>

<p>
Just as M'Vayne's boat was once more leaving the
beach, a heavier squall than any that yet had swept
over the sea dashed her back and beached her.  When
the wind subsided somewhat she was once more
launched, but had not proceeded far from the shore
when she found herself surrounded by wreckage.
</p>

<p>
Just for one moment, in the side of a darkling
wave and in a glimpse of moonlight, a white face
could be seen and a raised arm.
</p>

<p>
That was all, and the unfortunate fisherman's body
was never found.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Everything possible was done for the comfort of
Matty and her mother and father.  A bigger fire was
made up, and from his cupboard, honest, kind-hearted
Tomnahurich brought forth refreshments for them as
they sat before the roaring fire to get dry and warm.
The hermit even made tea for his guests, a luxury he
seldom indulged in himself, or Creggan either.  Then
he said "Good-night", blessed them in his semi-patriarchal
kind of way, and left with Willie Nugent.  They
reached the bottom of the cliff by the zigzag path
safely enough, though the spray dashed over them
in sheets of white and blinding foam.  It was indeed
a fearful night.
</p>

<p>
The boat had already been secured, and when they
entered the cave they found that a good fire had
already been lit by Creggan, and was roaring up the
rude chimney that led into a cleft in the rocks.
</p>

<p>
For a long time the hermit, with the two seamen
and Willie and Creggan, sat around the fire, talking
low during a lull in the storm, or remaining silent and
awe-struck when the huge waves boomed and crashed
against the rocks, seeming to shake the very island to
its foundations.
</p>

<p>
Sorrow induces sleep, and at last all turned in on
beds of heather, and the events of this terrible night
were forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Morning broke, bright and clear, but still the storm
raged on.
</p>

<p>
Skyemen, like most Highlanders, are very superstitious,
and one of these honest fishermen declared
that he had slept but little, for every now and then
he had heard poor Matheson&mdash;the drowned sailor&mdash;calling,
calling, calling from the deep.
</p>

<p>
The hermit assured him that it was but the scream
of the frightened sea-birds.
</p>

<p>
"Och and och no, Mr. Tomnahurich.  Mind you, I'll
no be sayin' it was Matheson himself&mdash;it was his wraith,
sure and sure enough!"
</p>

<p>
Prayers were row said, and a hymn sung to that
beautiful old melody called "Martyrdom", the hermit
leading with his clear and manly voice, which many a
night, when far at sea, had been heard high over the
raging storm and the dash of angry seas:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Take comfort, Christians, when your friends<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Jesus fall asleep;<br />
  Their better being never ends:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then dejected weep?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Why inconsolable as those<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom no hope is given?<br />
  Death is the messenger of peace,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And calls the soul to heaven."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
All seemed more cheerful after this, and breakfast
was cooked and eaten with relish.
</p>

<p>
Then the hermit and the two boys, who were
already great friends, ascended the cliff.  They met
Nugent, and were glad to hear that Matty and her
mother were well and happy.  They had been told
nothing about the lost sailor.
</p>

<p>
"There will be no getting on shore to-day, I fear,"
said Mr Nugent.
</p>

<p>
The hermit shook his head and pointed to the
seething sea, on which white horses[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>] were riding.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"No, sir, no," he said; "but we have plenty of food
and plenty of fire.  Heaven be praised!"
</p>

<p>
Tomnahurich all that day laid himself out to please
his guests.  He did all the cooking himself; and the
food was by no means to be despised, for the old man
was plentifully supplied with stores from shore,
Creggan being the purchaser.  Well, they had fish and
bacon, and the eggs of sea-birds, so beautiful in colour
and markings that Nugent said it was almost a sin to
break them.  The fish were of the best, for off the
rocks mullet can be caught with rod and line.  Rock
pigs these delightful little seafarers are called.
</p>

<p>
They had potatoes, butter, and, last but not least,
beautiful lobsters.  What more could anyone expect
on a hermit's isle?
</p>

<p>
When the sun went down the storm lulled somewhat,
but it was thought advisable to remain one more night
on the island.
</p>

<p>
After an early supper in the hut, and, the cave also,
where the fishermen remained as troglodytes&mdash;if you
don't know this word, dear young reader, take your
dictionary and look it up;&mdash;after an early supper, I say,
the hermit went down the cliff and returned soon.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to bring up my wife," he said with a
quiet smile.
</p>

<p>
"Your wife, Mr. M'Vayne!" cried Mrs. Nugent in
astonishment.  "Have you a wife, then?  We will be
delighted to see her."
</p>

<p>
"That you shall, and hear her too.  Her voice is
sweetness itself."
</p>

<p>
There was a roguish smile playing about his eyes as
he departed.
</p>

<p>
Creggan was in a corner near the fire talking low
to Matty, Pussy was curled up beside Collie (Oscar),
and Polly was making droll remarks to all, when
Tomnahurich entered with his "wife".
</p>

<p>
He carried her in a green baize bag.  A strange place
to stow away a wife in, it must be admitted.
</p>

<p>
"Have you brought Mrs. M'Vayne?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the hermit, "and here she is!"
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he opened the green baize bag, and
pulled out his Cremona fiddle.
</p>

<p>
He smiled, but he sighed as well.  "Och hey!" he
said; "this is the only wife I have now!"
</p>

<p>
But sweet was the music he brought from that old
fiddle.  Sweet and plaintive at first.  Then he sang
over it,&mdash;grand old sea-songs in which his listeners
could fancy they heard the "coo" and the "moan" of
the waves, as they dashed along the quarter of some
gallant ship, far, far at sea.
</p>

<p>
Then looking up, and thinking he was making the
young folks a trifle <i>triste</i> or sad, he burst into such
a rattling cheery sailor's hornpipe, that the children
laughed aloud in spite of themselves, while Polly
danced for joy on her perch, uttering every now and
then that real Irish "whoop!" which used to be heard
at Donnybrook Fair.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
That evening, as all sat in a wide circle around the
fire-peats and wood, and after a momentary lull in the
conversation, Mrs. Nugent addressed the hermit.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. M'Vayne," she said, "I noticed that you sighed
deeply when you took your violin from its bag.  Now,
I know yours may be a sad story, but will you not tell
it to us?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, tell us a stoly!" cried bonnie Matty, clapping
her tiny hands.
</p>

<p>
"I have never told my story to anyone hereabouts
yet," said the hermit; "not even to my sonny, Creggan
Ogg.  But," he added, "when ladies ask, what can I
do but obey."
</p>

<p>
"Well, light your pipe."
</p>

<p>
"May I?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
The hermit smoked for a minute or two, looking
into the fire, as if to renovate his memories of the
past.
</p>

<p>
Then he began.

CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
STORY OF THE SKYE CLEARINGS.
</h3>

<p>
"I must be brief, madam," the hermit began, as he
glanced at a little "wag-at-the-wa'",[<a id="chap04fn1text"></a><a href="#chap04fn1">1</a>] "for night
comes on apace."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn1text">1</a>] A small clock, with weights and pendulum exposed,
that is hung against the wall.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I was born, then, in Skye, and not fifty miles from
the spot where I and Creggan here now live."
</p>

<p>
"You were born in Skye," interrupted Mrs. Nugent,
"and yet you never go on shore!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, madam! there is a reason for that, which I
will presently tell you.  But for just one day I shall
go, I hope, before I die, and visit a green and lonesome
grave close to the cliffs where the sea-birds scream,
and where, for ever and for aye, one can hear the
moan of the waves&mdash;the sweet, sad song of the sea.
</p>

<p>
"I was born in a beautiful glen, and down near to
the beach was my father's cottage, only one of many
that clustered here and there, forming a village
without either street or lane, and more like the towns one
sees in Madagascar than anything else.  We were all
poor enough, goodness knows, but still we were happy.
Our farms were mere crofts, and we tilled only the
tops of the ridge with the wooden plough, or what is
called the crooked spade.  We paid but little rent, it is
true, but our wants were easily satisfied.  We were
called lazy by visitors who in summer passed through
the glen.  We were not.  For well we knew that if we
improved our land as some did, the grasping landlord
would at once raise our rent.
</p>

<p>
"We were&mdash;and many Skyemen are to this day&mdash;in
a condition of serfdom.  The old feudal system still
existed, and we had even to leave our own corn
standing until we cut down and stooked that on the
minister's large and beautiful glebe.  For this we
received nothing, and often before we were finished
at the manse, a wild, wet storm would come on and
our own little patches of grain would be spoiled.
</p>

<p>
"So far was feudalism carried, that the first and
choicest of the fish we caught, whether mullet or saith
or codling, had to be given to the minister, and the best
of the crabs and lobsters also.  In return for this the
minister visited the sick, with medicine in his
pocket&mdash;salts and senna or a nauseous pill.  But he never
brought food.  And many an old man or woman, aye,
and many an innocent child died, not of disease, but of
sheer starvation, although the minister's barns and
stackyards, and the landlord's also, were full to
overflowing.
</p>

<p>
"It was not from choice that we dwelt in those
windowless huts, with a raised stone in the centre,
around which the fire was built, with simply a hole
in the roof to let out the eye-racking smoke when
it chose to go.
</p>

<p>
"But in dark, dreary winters those roof-holes not
only permitted a little smoke to escape, but the snow to
drift in.  The soft, powdery snow also sifted in under
the door, and through the apertures in the eaves which
did duty as windows.
</p>

<p>
"It was no uncommon thing for some of these huts
to be entirely buried in the snow.  When one or two
neighbours escaped they dug the rest out.  For water
we often had to melt the snow.
</p>

<p>
"Food?  Well, madam, in summer we were not so
badly off; we had oatmeal and fish and a herring
harvest.  But in some icy winters, when we couldn't
launch a boat, and when fishing from the rocks was
useless, as the mullet refused to bite, we lived
principally on oatmeal&mdash;often bad at the best,&mdash;and limpets
that we gathered from the great black rocks when the
tide was back.  They are poor eating, but we gathered
dulse from the boulders, roasted it with a red-hot
poker, and ate it with the limpets.  At every door you
would have seen a large pile of empty limpet-shells,
that told of the poverty within.
</p>

<p>
"My father's hut was one of two rooms.  Our two
cows were turned into one at night and we occupied
the other.  There were many other huts with two
rooms and a cow, or perhaps more than one.  Often
the dividing partition between the cow's room and the
family apartment was but a few ragged old Highland
plaids hung upon a rope.
</p>

<p>
"They used to say that the breath of the kine and
the smoke were healthy, and kept us all strong and
hardy.  Well, as a boy I preferred the fresh air.  I
got plenty of this, because every day it was my duty
to collect all the cattle in the village, after they had
been milked, and, assisted by two honest collie dogs,
drive them far away to the uplands for pasture.
Would you believe it, madam, that even this privilege
was finally taken from us, and there being but little
herbage in the glen, many of us had to take our cows
to Portree and sell them?  Yes, our homes were
miserable enough; but still they were homes, and we
dearly loved them&mdash;loved the seas that swept the
craggy shores, loved the green braes, the rocks and
cliffs, and the grand old hills that frowned brown
o'er all the scene.  For home is home, be it ever so
humble.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I grew up to manhood.  Both father and
mother were now dead, and when one day the neighbours
saw me and some friends start building a better
sort of hut, they smiled to each other, nodded and
winked.  They knew what was coming.  True enough,
for I loved sweet Mary Gray as I believe only
Highlanders can love.  I won't bother you with this part
of my history.  But I just went on building my house.
You see it was like this, madam.  Many of the lads of
the glen went every year to the herring-fishery at
Peterhead, and thus we saved a little money; why, I
even got real glass windows from Portree, and had a
real chimney in my hut, chairs, and a good bed.  I
built also a byre for my two cows, so that I was
considered the richest man in the glen.
</p>

<p>
"Then one day Mary and I got married, and I'm
sure that when we were settled in our home there was
no more happy couple in all the glen, or in any other
glen.  I had no ambition then.  I only wanted to live
and die in our cottage by the sea.  And I used to take
down my fiddle, a gift from an Englishman whom I
had saved from drowning, and sing over it such love
ditties as this."
</p>

<p>
And the hermit played:

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Well, time wore on; a year and a half&mdash;Oh, what a
happy time!  Then a beautiful child saw the light of
day, and our joy was trebled.  But about three months
after this came a bolt from the blue&mdash;an order that
every man, woman, and child was to clear out of the
glen.
</p>

<p>
"We would have a free passage to America, but the
glen was wanted as a sheep-farm.
</p>

<p>
"What wailing and anguish there was now in every
hut and hamlet!
</p>

<p>
"But the men were furious.  They would take no
notice of the cowardly edict.  They could not, would
not, leave their Highlands.
</p>

<p>
"Another month went past, and then half a dozen
men from Portree arrived with summonses and
delivered them.  These long blue letters were torn from
their hands, rent in pieces, and thrown fluttering on
the breeze.  The men tried to use their sticks.  There
was a battle, but a brief one.  The minions of an
unjust law were soundly thrashed, and two were
thrown into a pond.  They were glad to get away
with their lives, I think.
</p>

<p>
"Police were sent next, and a more terrible fight
ensued.  Many of our brave glensmen were wounded,
but eventually this enemy also had to beat a speedy
retreat.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing more happened for three weeks, and we
were beginning to think we should be left in the
peaceful possession of our bonnie glen.  But one day,
much to our surprise, a small steamer cast anchor in
the bay, and on her deck were redcoats.  Alas!  I
knew now the grief had come.  But still we determined
to resist to the bitter end.  Bitter it was bound
to be, for it was a cold, bleak day in early winter.
</p>

<p>
"We speedily placed heaps of stones where they
would be handiest.
</p>

<p>
"The fight lasted till nearly darkling.  We kept
well beyond reach of the fixed bayonets, and battered
the soldiers severely with stones.  Again and again
the order was given to charge.  But these fellows
might as well have tried to follow Highland deer on
foot as lithe and active Skyemen like us.
</p>

<p>
"At last the order was given to fire, and two of our
poor fellows were stretched bleeding on the grass.
</p>

<p>
"The end had come.  What is a stone-armed mob
against soldiers with ball cartridge!
</p>

<p>
"So we gave in, and I myself advanced with a
white rag tied to my stick as a flag of truce.
</p>

<p>
"But the officer in charge was furious.  He must
do his duty, he said.  He had dallied too long.  Out
we must turn.  He would give us an hour to save any
small articles we valued, no more.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, madam, fancy the sadness of that night!
The old, the young, and the infirm were turned forth
into the bleak cold of a wind-swept glen.  The sick
were carried out in blankets, and put down on the
bare green braes to die or to live.
</p>

<p>
"Then at midnight every hamlet was fired, and the
glen was lit up by a blood-red blaze that tipped even
the distant hills with carmine, while tongues of flame,
mounting every moment higher and higher, seemed to
lick up the rolling clouds of smoke, while showers
of sparks, thick as flakes of snow in a winter's storm,
were carried far away to leeward.
</p>

<p>
"I was dazed.  I knew not what to do.  I knelt
beside my poor Mary, but she spoke not.  How cold
her hand was!  And her face.  'Ah,' I shrieked, 'my
wife, my wife is dead!'
</p>

<p>
"I remember nothing more.  I had fainted, but in
the dusk of the morning I recovered my senses.  Not
only was Mary dead, but poor baby had rolled over
her on to the grass, and there lay stark and stiff."
</p>

<p>
Tears were trickling down the hermit's cheeks, and
it was some time before he felt fit to continue his
story.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, madam," he said, "that was a sad morning.
The people of the glen, I could just see, were all
loaded on to that steamer, which was to bear them
away, far away across the broad Atlantic.  I could
hear their weeping and wailing, I could see the women
wringing their hands and the men tearing their hair
as they gazed on the land they should never see
again.  The soldiers, too, were on board, and steam up.
Speedily she rounded the cape, and I was left alone
with the dead.
</p>

<p>
"All that day I lay beside Mary and baby, and all
the next bleak, cold night.  The people that crowded
in kindness to the deserted glen could not get me
to move.
</p>

<p>
"But next day I consented to have my darlings
buried.
</p>

<p>
"And there they lie, and my heart lies also in that
shallow grave.
</p>

<p>
"Since then, madam, and until I came to this
island, my life has been one of constant wandering by
land and on the sea.  I am a good sailor, but I have
also been gold-miner, treasure-hunter, and pearl-fisher
by turns.  Anything that could give me excitement
and help me to forget was new life to me, so my
career has been a chequered one.
</p>

<p>
"I have made a little money, and that is safe.  But
at long last an indescribable longing to visit dear old
Skye seized me, and I returned to Glasgow.  Here I
bought a boat, and having been offered a passage as
far as Skye in a sailing ship, which, however, did not
mean to put in there, I gladly accepted it, buying
stores, &amp;c., and feeling that if it were possible I
should get a site for a house however humble, and
live once more near to baby's and Mary's lonely
grave.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my heart failed me at the last moment, and
when the kindly skipper lowered my boat and stores
and bade me farewell, instead of rowing to the glen I
landed here with my parrot.  And here I have been
ever since, and here I may remain, madam, till God
calls me.  I am willing to live, but I am also ready to
die.
</p>

<p>
"And my sonny here,"&mdash;he put an arm over
Creggan's shoulder as he spoke,&mdash;"who came to me
in so strange a way, and has been such comfort to
me, he, I say, must go out into life soon and see the
world.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, lad, hush!  You must have a career&mdash;you
must be a sailor!
</p>

<p>
"Why," he added, "you may yet clear up the
mystery of your childhood.  But come, children, I
fear I have saddened you;" and once more this strange
mortal put his fiddle under his chin, and dashed off
into one of the maddest, merriest airs the Nugents
had ever listened to.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Next morning all the hermits were landed, Matty
being delighted because Creggan took her, and her
only, in his skiff.
</p>

<p>
It was a lovely day now, blue sky above and
rippling waves beneath and around, that broke in
long white lisping lines on the beach where they
landed.
</p>

<p>
M'Ian and Creggan's two playmates, Rory and
Maggie, were delighted to see them all.  Their
anxiety had been very great, for pieces of wreckage
had been washed up on the beach, and they believed
that every soul on board the lugger had perished.
They dined at the manse, and afterwards Nugent
took Creggan aside.
</p>

<p>
"Come with me for a walk, my boy.  I have something
to say to you, but I must have you all alone."
</p>

<p>
So off they went, down along the cliffs, and at last
seated themselves on the grass, high above the blue
Minch, the summer sunshine sparkling on the sea, and
the soft summer wind perfumed with the odour of
wild thyme.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
A TERRIBLE ADVENTURE.
</h3>

<p>
Mr. Nugent sat down among the wild thyme,
and beckoned to Creggan to follow his example.
</p>

<p>
Then he lit a huge meerschaum, and smoked in
silence for a time, gazing thoughtfully far over the
Minch at the mountains of Harris, that lay like clouds
of blue on the horizon.
</p>

<p>
"Now boy," he said at last, "I'm a plain-spoken man.
You were instrumental in saving my life, my wife's,
and dear Matty's.  How can I reward you?  Not with
money, I know.  You couldn't have lived so long in
Skye without being proud."
</p>

<p>
He smiled as he spoke, afraid apparently of offending
the brave and spirited lad.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I don't want any reward at all, I only did
my duty, and the hermit has often told me that when
I clearly saw my duty, I was to go straight for it,
through thick and thin.  But, sir&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused, looking shy.
</p>

<p>
"Well, lad?"
</p>

<p>
"You may lend me a book to read."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Nugent took his pipe out of his mouth to
laugh aloud.
</p>

<p>
"A book, my boy!  A book for saving all our lives!
Ha, ha, ha!  This is really too amusing.
</p>

<p>
"But, tell me," he added, "what you would like to
be?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing at all.  Just live on the island with
Daddy."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, that will never do."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I suppose I must leave Daddy and Oscar,
but if I do, I shall go to sea, before the mast."
</p>

<p>
"That will never do either.  Now, your hermit
Daddy told me that he had gold, and that all was yours.
I have not very much gold, but, lad, I have influence,
much influence, and it is into the Royal Navy you must
go as a brave cadet, and if you keep up your
self-respect and never give way to temptations, I feel
certain your career will be a brilliant one.  What do
you say?"
</p>

<p>
There was a big lump in Creggan's throat, and as he
gazed across the Minch he could see his dear island
home only through a mist of tears.
</p>

<p>
But he turned bravely round and said to Nugent:
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir; I will go into the navy and try to
do my duty."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that is spoken right manfully.  Leave all the
rest to me.  All you have got to do is to continue your
studies; but take plenty of open air exercise as well,
for in the service they like strong hardy boys."
</p>

<p>
Then he shook hands with Creggan and rose to go.
</p>

<p>
"We will be three weeks longer in this wild and
romantic island, and during that time you'll be our
guide, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"That I will, sir," said Creggan, his eyes all in a
sparkle now.  "I'll show you everything, and Matty
can always ride on the Shetland pony.  Can't she?"
</p>

<p>
"You young rascal," replied Mr. Nugent laughing.
"I believe you have fallen in love with my little
Matty!"
</p>

<p>
Creggan blushed, but spoke out straightforwardly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about love, sir.  I love Oscar and
Daddy, but I like Matty so very, very much.  To be
sure she is a child; but she is pretty, and talks just
like a linnet."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, boy, the sea will soon drive all that out
of your noddle."
</p>

<p>
So they parted, and soon Creggan's little skiff was
dancing over the wavelets, her prow turned towards
Kilmara.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Dear boy readers, I hope that many of you will one
day visit the Island of Wings&mdash;Skye.  I've travelled
the world around, but I have never yet landed on a
wilder or more romantic island.  I have no idea of
describing the grandeur of its scenery.  Walter Scott
himself were he alive could not do that; but if I now
close my eyes just for a moment, it rises before me, its
mountains towering far into the blue of the skies; its
thousand-feet-high cliffs; its bonnie bosky glens; its
long stretches of heath-clad moorland; its streams; its
torrents; its castles, mostly ruins, that carry the thoughts
back and away into the long forgotten feudal past;
and, last but not least, its dark tarns or lochs, and
the awful desolation of some of its cañons.
</p>

<p>
But independent of the wildness of its scenery, Skye
is not only a man's paradise as regards sport, but a
boy's as well, if he is fond of fishing.  The dark lakes
abound in trout, and all around the island the sea is
alive with fish.

<p>
It was not only for three weeks, but four, that the
Nugents remained on the island, and happy weeks
indeed they were to Creggan, and I'm sure to Matty also.
The bracing sea breezes that blew across the hills and
braes had heightened her colour, and she now looked
more like a fairy than ever.  Only, as a rule fairies
don't ride on Shetland ponies through the bonnie
crimson heather.
</p>

<p>
Many a dark night at sea while keeping the middle
watch, when hardly a sound was to be heard, except
now and then the nap of a great sail overhead, or the
dreary cry of some belated sea-bird, did Creggan's
thoughts revert to those days he had spent in the
Island of Wings with the Nugents.
</p>

<p>
And when the stars were shining overhead, so big, so
clear, and so close that it seemed as if the main-truck
could touch them, the sailor-boy used to hope, aye,
and pray, that he might be spared to go back to Skye,
to see old Daddy, and to meet the Nugents&mdash;especially
Matty&mdash;once again.
</p>

<p>
His adventures with the child were principally
among the heather or at sea in the skiff.  He was so
strong a boy, and so tall and brave that neither
Nugent himself nor his wife were afraid to trust him
with the child.  So, on fine days he used to row her
right away out to the hermit's isle itself, and spend
hours listening to the old man's yarns, but above all to
his music.
</p>

<p>
Well, the two would sink baited lobster-traps in the
deep water near the towering cliffs, on which stood the
grand old castle of Duntulm.  They used to go for
those lobster creels next day, and always found plenty
of shell-fish.
</p>

<p>
Or they would fish from the boat lent them by a
fisherman, the saith leaping at times around them as
thick as rain-drops in a thunderstorm.
</p>

<p>
But it was even more pleasant to sit on the rocks,
and fish with a white fly for mullet or herring.  The
idea of angling for herring may seem a droll one to a
South Briton, but it is done nevertheless, and many is
the good haul I have made myself.
</p>

<p>
From the place where the children used to fish, to
Nugent's little home was a good three miles' walk.
They had to pass over a chain of boulders, where wild
cats dwelt.  One evening they had stayed longer
fishing than usual, and it was quite gloaming ere they
reached the stony chaos.
</p>

<p>
Matty was trembling with fear, so Creggan threw
his plaid around her, placing her on his right hand,
because that was nearest to the sea, and not to that
cleft and precipitous mountain face where the danger
lay.  Matty crept as close to the boy as she could.
</p>

<p>
Now, Creggan usually carried a stout stick with a
pointed iron-shod end.  It was well, indeed, that he
had it to-night.  For they had hardly got half-way
through the chaotic mass of boulders, when the boy
saw something dark in the road ahead that made his
heart beat quicker for Matty's sake.
</p>

<p>
The something dark sprang off the road as Creggan
and Matty slowly advanced.  Indeed the child had not
seen it, for she had quite buried her head and face in
the plaid.  The boy was beginning to think that the
danger was over, but he grasped his cudgel nevertheless.
Lucky for him he did so, for they had advanced
but fifty yards farther, when with an unearthly and
eldritch yell that dark something sprang at Creggan's
neck.
</p>

<p>
It was doubtless the scent of the fish that had
excited the monster.  But the lad's stout plaid saved
him.  Matty had disengaged herself and stood
trembling by the roadside, while Creggan fought this
miniature tiger.
</p>

<p>
Again and again it charged, its eyes gleaming like
yellow diamonds.  Again and again the lad drove it
off.
</p>

<p>
Victory came at last, for with one well-aimed blow
it was laid dead on the road.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right now, Matty," cried Creggan cheerfully.
"Come on, a run will warm us."
</p>

<p>
So it did, and they soon got clear of the "Wild Cats
Cairns", as the ugly place was called.
</p>

<p>
But they never permitted themselves to be belated
again.
</p>

<p>
These wild cats are still common enough in Sutherlandshire,
and the adventure I have just related is very
similar to one a boy had in that county.  The cat
on this occasion sprang from a tree.  The lad was
severely wounded, and although he managed to beat
the beast off he did not succeed in killing it.
</p>

<p>
In the soft and fleshy part of the middle finger of
my left hand are still the marks of the bite of a wild
cat, with whom I had a difference of opinion.  The
beast had the best of it, and I went about with my
arm slung to my head for three weeks at least.
</p>

<p>
That ruined castle of Duntulm was a favourite
resort with the children.  The donjon-keep was still
entire, and from a window, or the hole where a window
had been, one could look down over the precipice into
the deep but clear water; and Matty used to clap her
hands with joy to witness the great medusæ or
jellyfish swimming about.  Very beautiful indeed they
were; some as big as a small open parasol, and fringed
with long soft legs that kicked about in the drollest
fashion.
</p>

<p>
Creggan used to read Ossian in English to Matty,
and she would listen with open eyes to the wild and
wondrous stories, all so full of romance and war.  He
knew the history of the castle too.  It was at one time,
he told Matty, the head stronghold of one of the
M'Donald clans, and here dwelt the warlike chief.
But across the sea-loch was the M'Leod country, and
in his strong castle of Dunvegan dwelt the head of
the clan.  This castle is still inhabitable.  Between the
M'Donalds and the M'Leods was a blood feud, and
many a fearful fight was the result.
</p>

<p>
Once the M'Donalds surprised the M'Leods in church.
They heaped up banks of peats and wood in front of
doors and windows, and burned or smothered every
man, woman, and child.  But the M'Leods took a
terrible revenge, and for a long time the M'Donalds
were quiet.  But a thirst for revenge still lay latent
in the breast of the Highland chief, and one day, under
the guise of friendship, he enticed M'Leod to Duntulm
Castle.  When M'Leod arrived with his followers the
latter were immediately set upon and slain, and
although M'Leod himself laid about him boldly with
his broad claymore, he was eventually captured and
thrust into the donjon-keep.
</p>

<p>
Here he was kept for nearly two days without food.
Then a trencher of salt beef was handed into him, and
a large flagon which M'Leod thought was sack&mdash;a kind
of claret.  He ate heartily, then turned to the flagon
to allay his thirst.
</p>

<p>
Alas, it contained only sea-water!
</p>

<p>
So poor M'Leod perished miserably of thirst and
delirium.
</p>

<p>
This is a strange story, reader, but I have every
reason to believe it is a true one.  It quite entranced
little Matty, and when Creggan had finished she sighed,
looked wistfully into his face with her bonnie blue
eyes, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Do tell us some more!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE.
</h3>

<p>
Willie Nugent was as far from being what
we call a "snob" as anyone could well wish.
Looks are nothing, so long as one is pleasant and
affable, so long as the ready smile&mdash;not the artificial
one&mdash;beginning at the lips spreads upwards over the
face like morning sunrise, and so long as heart and
soul speak through a pair of kindly sympathetic eyes.
</p>

<p>
Well, Willie Nugent was not extremely good-looking.
For my own part I do not like to see what we
called "pretty boys", because they are usually
goody-goody, namby-pamby, and affected, sometimes even
effeminate.  But Willie was manly in appearance, and
so kind-hearted that I am certain he would not have
trampled on a beetle crossing his path.
</p>

<p>
Creggan Ogg[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>] M'Vayne was at best, for the present
at all events, only a peasant boy, and had not Willie
been a bold, frank Colonial young gentleman he
might have treated Creggan with some approach to
hauteur.  In his face at times, had he been a snob,
there might have been a look that said plainly enough,
"Not too near, please".
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn1text">1</a>] Ogg is really a Gaelic word, and the "o" is pronounced long:
thus "Oag".  It signifies "young".
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Instead of this he noted at a glance all the good in
Creggan'a character, and, figuratively speaking, held
out to him the right hand of fellowship and <i>camaraderie</i>
from the first day they met.
</p>

<p>
Willie was like his little sister in many of his ways,
and Creggan loved him all the more for this.
</p>

<p>
I think that nothing cements friendship between
two boys more than a long tour on the road.  Skye
isn't much of a place for cycling, you must know.
If you attempted to cross country your bike would
be just as often on your back as beneath you, and
there is a probability that a dive over a precipice
might end your earthly career.  But there is no
grander country in which to travel that I know of,
even if you do not climb the mountains, many of
which, however, are all but inaccessible, even to
members of Alpine clubs.
</p>

<p>
So one beautiful summer day, when a wavy transparency
like molten glass or the clearest of water
seemed rising from the ground, when the sky was
ethereal-blue, with here and there just the ghost of
a cloud, and a gentle breeze blowing from far over the
wide Atlantic, Willie and Creggan, with their knapsacks
on their backs and sticks in their hands, started
to explore the land.  Of course Matty had a good cry,
and kissed both boys.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she cried, in semi-Scriptural language, "don't
let any naughty evil beast devour you!"
</p>

<p>
Away the lads went, their hearts as light and
joyous as that of the laverock[<a id="chap06fn2text"></a><a href="#chap06fn2">2</a>] yonder, who, hovering
high in the brightness of the sky, so high that he
could hardly be seen, trilled his jubilant morning
song.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn2text">2</a>] Scottice="lark", but a much more musical word.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Creggan had on his very best Highland costume,
the suit he wore every Sunday to kirk, and Willie
was neatly clad in strong Scotch tweed, so neither
were likely to suffer from the dews of night should
they be belated.
</p>

<p>
They bent their steps first to the bonnie wee village
of Uig that nestles close to the loch, an arm of the
sea.  And here they had an excellent second breakfast,
and much enjoyed the well-cooked mullet, the
delicious ham and eggs&mdash;the latter those of the
seagulls,&mdash;and the butter and white crisp cakes.
</p>

<p>
They had tea.
</p>

<p>
The landlady was good-hearted evidently.
</p>

<p>
"And is it," she said, "is it that you won't be taken
just a thistleful[<a id="chap06fn3text"></a><a href="#chap06fn3">3</a>] of mountain-dew to make your meal
digest?"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn3text">3</a>] A glass shaped like a thistle.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But the boys only laughed and shook their heads.
</p>

<p>
The sea out yonder was very blue and still to-day,
but while Willie was gazing away across it, somewhat
pensively perhaps, suddenly first one then another and
a third great fountain of snow-white spray was thrown
about twenty feet into the air.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, look, look, Creggan!  What can it be?"
</p>

<p>
"Only the blowing whales," our young hero
replied.  "They are always about.  And there are
always plenty of seals about the low rocks, but I
never shoot them, because they are so beautiful, and
have eyes that look through and through you."
</p>

<p>
In their march across a long heathy moorland on
their way to Quiraing, for the first time in his life
Willie Nugent had the pleasure of seeing a real
Scottish eagle.  He was wheeling round and round in
circles, but ever upwards, as if he would seek to reach
the sun itself, and ever and anon his wild whistling
scream made hills and rocks resound.
</p>

<p>
"There now," cried Creggan, pointing skywards,
"that isn't a lark this time.  And that isn't a lark's
song."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Willie, gazing wonderingly up at the
huge bird.
</p>

<p>
He added:
</p>

<p>
"I think I should like to be an eagle.  Is it true
they take babies to their nests?"
</p>

<p>
"They build," said Creggan, "on shelves of rock,
that in some parts here rise sheer up from the sea
a thousand feet or more.  Their nests are huge
bundles of sticks, built as a wild pigeon arranges
her nest, and in the centre is often moss, hay, and
feathers.  These are called eeries.  Men or big boys
have sometimes been let down by ropes to rob these
of their yellow, fluffy, red-throated gaping fledglings;
but Mr M'Ian says it is very cruel, and highly
dangerous.  Once, when a man went down like this
and stood on the eerie, where whole skeletons of lambs
lay bleaching in the sun, and many other strange
bones as well, the she-eagle with a deafening scream
dashed at him.  He managed to beat her off, and the
fight for a time was fearful.  He signalled soon to be
hauled up, but hardly was he in the air before the
eagle swooped down again.  This time she tore at the
rope, and&mdash;oh! wasn't it awful, Willie?&mdash;it snapped,
and the man was hurled down, down eight hundred
feet into the sea."
</p>

<p>
"Terrible!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But though his body was found it was a
headless trunk, for in his descent, you know, and
when about half-way down, a piece of sharp rock cut
the head clean off; and they do say that when well
out to sea you can see the bleached skull, if you have
a good glass, grinning on that shelf of rock."[<a id="chap06fn4text"></a><a href="#chap06fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn4"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn4text">4</a>] The same kind of accident occurred to a shepherd in Skye,
who had fallen over a precipice while trying to save a lamb.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
They went on now.
</p>

<p>
Not only was the moorland covered with moss and
green heather, but many charming wild flowers were
scattered about, with here and there patches of
sweetly-scented bog-myrtle and white downy toad's-tail,
and the whole place was musical with the song of
tit-larks and linnets.
</p>

<p>
They climbed that day high up into the crater of
the extinct volcano Quiraing.  Right in the centre is a
round raised green plot, big enough to drill a company
of soldiers on.  At one side the wall of rock is black,
wet, and solid, but at the other it is split up into
needles, higher far than Cleopatra's on the Thames
embankment, and between these, to-day, the boy-adventurers
could catch glimpses of a sea of Italian blue,
dotted here and there with many a sail, snow-white or
brown.
</p>

<p>
To gaze on such a scene as this, in a silence so dread
that you could hear the water dropping from the
rocks, is very impressive; but like everything solemn
and beautiful in nature, I think it brings one into closer
union with God.
</p>

<p>
Having slid down about five hundred feet through
a chaos of shingle, the boys completed the descent on
firm ground, and then bent their footsteps back to Uig.
They were tired enough to sleep soundly after a capital
supper, and next day they crossed the loch to visit the
land of the M'Leods, and the grand old feudal castle of
Dunvegan.
</p>

<p>
And so, on and on and on for many days, by moor
and mount and fell, and by many a brown and lonesome
tarn, the boys wandered.  They cared not either
to fish or to collect specimens.  Amidst such scenery
and surroundings, in the glad sunshine and bracing
air, to live was sufficient happiness.
</p>

<p>
I cannot say they had any wild adventures worth
the name.  They saw many huge heather snakes
curled up in the sunshine asleep, but passed them
by.
</p>

<p>
Once when on a moorland, they felt very hungry
and there was no house near.  But after walking a
mile or two farther, a shepherd's hut hove in sight
There was no one inside except the comely wife of
the shepherd, who was away on the hills with his
flocks.
</p>

<p>
But this woman was as kindly as comely, and
regaled the lads with pea-meal bannocks and creamy
milk.  Willie averred it was the best meal ever he
sat down to.  Nor would the good lady accept even
sixpence for her hospitality.
</p>

<p>
They bade her good-bye.
</p>

<p>
"The nearest road," she said in Gaelic, "is across that
grassy moor.  It would save three miles, but it is
swarming with adders.  I advise you to go round."
</p>

<p>
But the saving of those three miles tempted the lads,
and they took to the grassy moor.  The patch altogether
was barely two hundred yards across.  The grass was
longish, withered and dry, and they soon found to
their dismay that it literally swarmed with vipers.  It
was the home of the viper, and the viper was at home.
They heard them in their hundreds rustling about, and
they saw them too.  But the lads would not show the
white feather.  To walk across, however, would have
increased the danger.  So they took to their heels and
ran, as barefooted boys do when passing across a field
of low white clover, with bees in thousands on it.
The bees haven't time to sting, and in this case the
vipers hadn't time to bite even if trampled on.
</p>

<p>
"That's a sweater!" said Willie, when they landed
safe on bare ground.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go round by the road next time," said Creggan
laughing.
</p>

<p>
However, all is well that ends well, so they went on
their way rejoicing.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't the first time that Creggan, young though
he was, had made a walking tour in Skye, so he made
an excellent guide for his friend.
</p>

<p>
Near to the wildest scenery of Scavaig, Coruisk,
and the Cuchullin mountains, they lived for a day or
two at a hotel that was palatial.  Almost too much
so, indeed, for simple Creggan's taste.  He was not
accustomed to carpeted rooms and silver forks, so
he told Willie.  He was at home in a moorland, he
said, but not among lords and ladies dressed in silk
and satin.
</p>

<p>
But Willie only laughed, and did all he could to put
him to rights, and to teach him the manners and
customs of polite society, both at table and in the
drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
However, Creggan sighed like a steam-engine&mdash;a
sigh of relief, however,&mdash;when he found himself once
more in the cosy parlour of an old-fashioned glen
inn.
</p>

<p>
"This is true pleasure, Willie," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Well," answered Willie, "I'm not shy, you know.
I am as much at home in an old farmer's house as
in a nobleman's drawing-room.  Always keep cool,
Creggan.  Don't imagine people are staring at you
in particular, and if ladies in society say pretty things
to you or praise you up, don't get hysterical, for they
never mean it."
</p>

<p>
Creggan laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes," continued Willie, "I am asked to sing
or recite.  By people who don't know me, I mean.
They say, 'Now, Master Nugent, I'm sure you can
favour us with a song, or a recitation'.  'Most
certainly', I reply, and do both; but as I sing like a crow
and recite like a hen that has just dropped an egg,
they never ask me twice."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
There were just one or two little things that marred
the pleasure of this wild and delightful tour.  They
were indeed little, but very wicked.  First there were
the midges.  Among the bushes or in a garden in the
glens, there is no going out of doors of an evening
without muslin over one's face.  If one neglects this,
the face will be bitten all over, till it resembles badly
pickled cabbage.
</p>

<p>
Then the gnats or mosquitoes are very venomous.
Centipeds abound in some parts, great healthy
greenish-brown brutes, and if they bite you in a
tender part, it is nearly as bad as a snap from an
adder.  In the dark you may see these fellows
hurrying through the short grass like miniature
railway-trains, all aglow with a phosphorescence that
streams out from both sides of them.  Centipeds are
nasty persons and have more legs than they know
what to do with.
</p>

<p>
Away up on the moorlands, however, you don't find
these things; only daddy-long-legs in millions in
August.  They are so tame that they are troublesome.
Their favourite seat is a-straddle of one's
nose.
</p>

<p>
"Give us a ride old chap," they seem to say.  "I'm
going the same way as you."
</p>

<p>
I believe myself that the best plan is to leave the
duddy on your nose, though I confess it looks funny;
but, as certain as sunrise, if you knock one off another
gets on.  So what are you to do?
</p>

<p>
Well, at long last the two young tourists, somewhat
dusty and tired, and sadly in need of clean collars, bore
round to Portree.
</p>

<p>
Here they rested one night.
</p>

<p>
Portree is a nice little town, and the people are
kind and obliging.  But there is a herring there,
and you can scent him, either in boats or reclining
in a frying-pan, wherever you go.
</p>

<p>
I forget how many miles it is from Portree round
the northern portion of the island to Duntulm Castle.
Perhaps thirty.  The boys hired a boat to take them
round, and a more delightful row or grander rock-and-mountain
scenery it would indeed be difficult to conceive.
</p>

<p>
Willie wondered to see the tartan rocks, but he
wondered still more to see a waterfall shoot right
over a cliff many hundreds of feet in height, so that
you could have sailed a boat between the rock and
the linn, and hardly get wet even with the spray.
</p>

<p>
There are no such sunsets anywhere in Britain as
there are in Skye.  This evening the sun went down
in a glory of crimson, gray, and orange, which it is
impossible to describe.
</p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
Matty could not have been more rejoiced to see
Creggan had he been away for a year.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I is glad you've comed!" she cried, jumping on
his knee with childish abandon.
</p>

<p>
Then in the starlight, Creggan launched his skiff
and rowed swiftly away across a heaving waveless sea,
to where the beacon burned afar on his own little island
home of Kilmara.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
LOST IN A HIGHLAND MIST.
</h3>

<p>
Soon now the scene must change, and we shall find
ourselves afloat on the dark blue sea, and taking
part in adventures far more thrilling than any that
could possibly be met with even in the wild Island of
Wings itself.  I have said that, when not fishing or
boating with Matty, Creggan used to be guide to
Mr. Nugent and show him all the sights.  In these devious
wanderings both rode, when the ground permitted it,
Nugent on a pretty bay mare, Creggan on a daft little
Shetland pony, who sometimes pitched him off and
then rolled on him.  Only play certainly, but play
may be a trifle rough at times.
</p>

<p>
For example, I was walking&mdash;in full uniform&mdash;one
day in a lonely part of the city of Zanzibar.  Well,
just as I entered one end of a rather narrow lane
a camel entered the other.  There wasn't a soul in
the street but our two selves.
</p>

<p>
"There is plenty of room to pass," I said to myself.
So on I went, and on came the camel, with his head half
a mile in the air (more or less).  When we met about
the centre, instead of nodding to me in a friendly way
and saying "<i>Yambo sana</i>" (good luck to you), he
snuffed the air, grinned, uttered a little scream and
made straight for me.  I thought my hour had come.
He didn't bite, however&mdash;he did worse.  He crunched
me against the wall and turned me right round.  Oh,
how I ached!  For the next hour or two I felt as flat
as a pancake.  I have never trusted camel or dromedary
since.
</p>

<p>
But just one little adventure before we leave dear
old romantic Skye&mdash;for a time, at all events.
</p>

<p>
It was early morning.
</p>

<p>
Creggan had just finished a homely but delicious
breakfast of mullet, crisp oat-cakes with butter, and
sea-gulls' eggs, and after bidding Daddy good-bye, had
launched his skiff, and with faithful Oscar in the
bows might have been seen speeding shorewards over
a blue but somewhat uncertain sea.
</p>

<p>
"Might have been seen," I said.  Yes, and was seen.
For look yonder, a tiny tottie of a child high on the
cliff-top waving a white handkerchief to him.
</p>

<p>
Creggan replies, and at once Matty disappears.  She
is making a somewhat perilous descent a-down the
high cliff, which here is of grass and rock commingled.
She is there on the beach to meet Creggan and his collie
doggie nevertheless.  And now after the usual affectionate
greetings she scrambles into the skiff, and, with
reason or none, the lad has to take her for a little row.
</p>

<p>
They are soon on shore again, for Creggan has
promised to guide Mr. Nugent far over the mountains,
in order that he may make some additions to his
collection of Skye flora.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, welcome, Creggan lad!" he cried, as the latter,
hand in hand with Matty, came up the little path that
led to the bungalow.  "What do you think of the
weather, my child of the ocean wave?" he added
merrily.  For despite the severe style of his whiskers
he could be right merry when he liked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite like it," answered Creggan dubiously.
</p>

<p>
"And why, lad?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, you see it is nine now, and the hills
haven't taken their night-caps[<a id="chap07fn1text"></a><a href="#chap07fn1">1</a>] off yet.  That is one
thing.  Then the sea is a bit lumpy, and every now and
then comes a puff, making big cat's-paws on it."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap07fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap07fn1text">1</a>] The morning mist on the mountain-tops is so called.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Well, lad, I start in two days' time for the tame,
domestic south of England, so if you are willing I'll
venture."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," answered Creggan flushing a little, "I'm
ready, sir, aye ready!"
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!"
</p>

<p>
Willie and his mother were off to Portree, so poor
Matty would have a lonesome day with only the
servants to amuse her.  The journey would have been
too much for Matty at any rate.  After a second
breakfast at eleven o'clock they started.  One, by the
by, can always eat two breakfasts in Skye, just as I
do while travelling in my caravan, "The Wanderer".
</p>

<p>
Oscar went with them of course.  Oscar went
everywhere.  And so much did Creggan love the dog,
that his heart beat high and the tears sprang to his
eyes when he thought that in about six months' time
they would have to part.
</p>

<p>
And who can blame one for loving a dog?
</p>

<p>
Right happy were Mr. Nugent and Creggan as they
set out over the moor towards the mountains that
forenoon, while Oscar ran on in front barking for joy,
sometimes starting a bird, and actually pretending to
jump after it into the sky.
</p>

<p>
"If I only had bits of wings," he appeared to say,
"I'd soon catch that quack-quacking old duck."
</p>

<p>
The hills had by this time thrown off their nightcaps
and were fully awake, but the wind seemed on
the increase, blowing in uncertain squalls, then dying
away again into a calm.  This is always an ugly sign.
Besides, there was a nasty bank of "sugar-loaf clouds",
as Creggan called them, rising slowly in the west.
Nor did Creggan like the appearance of them, and
said so to Mr. Nugent.
</p>

<p>
"Never meet troubles half-way, my lad," was the
answer.  "For troubles, you know, are never quite so
bad when they do come as we imagined they would
be.  The cloud approaching the moon is black and
dark, but lo! when it gets in front the light shines
through."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir," said Creggan, "I shall always try to
think of that, but I myself do not mind storms.
I was thinking of lonely Matty's father if we get
lost."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Creggan had a botanical case slung over his shoulder
and Nugent a much larger one.  This latter contained
the luncheon.
</p>

<p>
They collected a large number of specimens on an
upland moor they reached about one o'clock.  Many
of these were well-known to the boy, but he could
only give Gaelic and English names to them.
</p>

<p>
Now, in a mountainous or Alpine region like that
of Skye, however high you climb it seems there are
still higher hills ahead of you.  By three o'clock
Creggan suggested that they should not go farther.
</p>

<p>
It was good advice, for the sea-damp wind from the
west was increasing every minute, while away to the
east the moisture had already condensed against the
cold sides of the lofty hills, and here the wind was
blowing high, sweeping before it a genuine Scotch
mist.
</p>

<p>
Very few people in England have any idea what
a real Scotch mist means.  Some think it is a fog,
some a drizzle.  It is neither.  It is rain broken up
into mist by the violence of the wind, and driven
along the sides of the hills or valleys in intermittent
clouds.  It is searching, bitter, miserable, and will not
only wet an Englishman to the skin in five minutes,
but will penetrate even the plaid of a Scot.
</p>

<p>
They now sat down to luncheon.  It was a very
sumptuous one, for Nugent was nothing if not a good
and generous eater.  As he discussed his meal he
talked away right merrily, and told Creggan scores of
humorous and other anecdotes of colonial life and
adventure.  So delightful were these that Creggan
said he longed to be there.
</p>

<p>
"If," he continued, "I could only take poor Oscar."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, my boy; Oscar is young, isn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Only two, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And you love him?"
</p>

<p>
"Very, very much."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I have a deal more influence than I care to
boast about.  So, after you have passed through the
<i>Britannia</i>, if you are appointed to a small ship, as
you most likely will be, I'll see to it that Oscar and
you shall not be parted."
</p>

<p>
Creggan's joy was so great that for a few moments
he dared not trust himself to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you, thank you, sir!" he said at last;
and then Oscar had an extra hug, for a load had been
lifted off his master's mind.
</p>

<p>
While talking thus they did not observe a bank of
rolling fog creeping gradually up the hillside.
</p>

<p>
Creggan saw the danger first and sprung to his
feet.
</p>

<p>
"We must hurry, sir; it is a fearful thing to be
lost in the mist all among the lonely mountains.
</p>

<p>
"If we hurry, though," he added, "I think we can
reach old Donald Clearach's cottage before the mist
gets near us."
</p>

<p>
All sail was now made downwards and homewards.
But this meant meeting the mist!
</p>

<p>
In less than an hour, and while only a mile from
the shepherd's hut, they were enveloped in so dense
a fog that even Oscar was puzzled.  Donald's hut
stood on a bit of moorland, that, though far above the
level of the sea, afforded excellent pasture for the
sheep he tended.
</p>

<p>
Well, it is far more confusing to walk in a fog like
this than in the dark of the darkest night, for one
speedily loses his bearings, and owing to the muscles
of the right side of the body being stronger than
those of the left, the person who is lost usually walks
round in a circle.
</p>

<p>
"What's to be done, boy?" said Nugent uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, sir, but wrap our plaids about us and
wait.  Even Oscar could not guide us now."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Nugent smiled faintly, lit his pipe, and sat
down.
</p>

<p>
The wind now began to get higher and higher, but
it had no visible effect upon the fog.
</p>

<p>
The time went on and on, oh! so slowly, although
Nugent continued to talk and tell of far-off lands
beyond the seas.
</p>

<p>
Six o'clock, seven, eight o'clock, came and passed.
But still no change.  Creggan had a splendid plaid, and
his companion a stout coat of frieze, but the wet, cold
mist that went curling round their necks made them
shiver and shudder.
</p>

<p>
"Is it not possible to proceed, lad?"
</p>

<p>
"No sir; we are on level ground now, you see, and
we should only go round and round and further
astray.  We might fall into a wild-duck pond and
get drowned.  Even if we were on a hillside, though
we could descend, we might go astray and tumble
over a precipice."
</p>

<p>
"You speak like an old man&mdash;wisely," said
Mr. Nugent.  "Well, anyhow we can have supper.  That
will warm us."
</p>

<p>
By the time they had finished it was dark.
</p>

<p>
The darkness soon grew dismal.  Not a star would
shine to-night, except far away beyond the clouds.
It was pleasant, though, to think and know that the
stars and moon were there.
</p>

<p>
Both now remained silent for a very long time.
Their faculties were quite benumbed with the cold.
</p>

<p>
Then Nugent lay back.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to sleep, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, just forty winks."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no!  I cannot let you, for many and many a
man lost on the moors as we now are has been found
stark and stiff when the mist cleared away, just because
of falling asleep."
</p>

<p>
His companion, now thoroughly aroused to a true
sense of his danger, tried to pull himself together.  He
even tried to tell more stories, but his teeth were
chattering in his head, and his lips were all but frozen.
He could not.
</p>

<p>
Soon after there was a wild blood-curdling eldritch
yell heard, that startled both.
</p>

<p>
"Heavens! what is it?" cried Nugent.
</p>

<p>
Something dark rushed past next moment at their
very feet.  It was a wild cat, and Oscar jumped up to
pursue it, but Creggan quickly caught him by the
collar.
</p>

<p>
"No, Oscar, no.  I might never see you more, and
you're going to sea with me, you know."
</p>

<p>
Another long dreary hour passed, perhaps two.
Both were now resigned to their fate.  They must
spend the night on the moor.
</p>

<p>
Even Creggan himself began to nod.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Oscar sprang up and uttered a short
defiant or challenging bark.
</p>

<p>
And lo! not far off, a light appeared glimmering
hazily through the dismal fog, and a spectre-like figure,
so magnified by the mist that it seemed to reach
from earth to heaven, slowly approached.
</p>

<p>
"Is it that there is any-pody here at all at all
whatefer?"
</p>

<p>
Once more Oscar barked, but it was with a ring of
joy and pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Donald, is that yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"To be surely, boy, to be surely; and is it you, my
dear lad Creggan?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I am so glad you've come!  This is my friend
Mr. Nugent, and we're lost, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, well, but it isn't long lost you'll be
whatefer.  Sure I know the sheepies' tracks, and can
guide you safely to my hut.
</p>

<p>
"Ay," he continued, "and it's as dead as braxie you'd
have been 'fore mornin' if I hadn't been out lookin'
for a sheepie."
</p>

<p>
How gladly they followed him need not be told,
and how delighted they were to find themselves seated
once more in front of a fire of wood and peats.
</p>

<p>
Donald hastened to make supper&mdash;oatmeal porridge
and milk.  Though eaten from caups[<a id="chap07fn2text"></a><a href="#chap07fn2">2</a>] and with horn
spoons, Nugent told the old shepherd that he had
never supped more sumptuously in his life.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap07fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap07fn2text">2</a>] Round, strong, wooden bowls.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Then Donald himself sat down, and while the two
collies fraternized in a corner, the men folks had a long
and enjoyable conversation.
</p>

<p>
Donald next made "shake-downs", or heather beds,
for both, and they slept as sound as babies.
</p>

<p>
Early astir they were, however, and after more
porridge and milk Nugent thanked the shepherd&mdash;solidly,
and away they went down the hill with poor Donald's
blessing ringing in their ears.
</p>

<p>
It was a bright and beautiful morning, with ne'er a
cloud in all the sky.
</p>

<p>
What a relief for poor Mrs. Nugent when they
entered the bungalow!  And innocent wee Matty must
jump up into Creggan's arms and cry for joy.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
CREGGAN AND OSCAR.
</h3>

<p>
"Boy, you've been crying," said the hermit one
forenoon, as Creggan jumped on shore with Oscar
from his little skiff.
</p>

<p>
He had been rowing more slowly to-day towards his
little island home.  Usually he made the skiff dance
over the water, singing as he rowed, but his arms
seemed to be lead this morning.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Daddy," said Creggan, with an apology for a
smile, "I&mdash;I&mdash;I'm afraid that I did let a tear or two
fall.
</p>

<p>
"I've been parting from the Nugents, you know,
and Matty would hang about my neck and cry&mdash;and
so I really couldn't help joining in for a moment.  Oh,
only for a moment, Daddy!  But partings are such
nasty things, aren't they?"
</p>

<p>
The hermit put his hand on the boy's head, and
looked kindly in his sunburnt face.
</p>

<p>
"Boy," he said, "never be ashamed to shed an honest
tear.  It is nature's way of showing that the heart
is in the right place.  As to partings, they are always
sad, and one of the joys of heaven will rest on the
fact that there won't be any more partings.  You mind
what the hymn says:[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'A few short years of evil past,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reach the happy shore,<br />
  Where death-divided friends at last<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall meet to part no more'.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap08fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap08fn1text">1</a>] <i>1 Thessalonians</i>, iv. 13 to the end.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"But come on, Creggan, and have dinner, I've
something very nice, and then I'll tell you stories.
Ah, we'll all be happy yet!"
</p>

<p>
But Creggan had another sad grief to face that
evening.
</p>

<p>
It will be remembered that Nugent had not only
promised to get him a cadetship for the Royal Navy&mdash;if
he could pass the examinations,&mdash;but, if appointed
to a small ship, work the oracle so that he might take
poor Oscar with him.
</p>

<p>
Well, as the boy and his foster-father sat by the fire
with the collie between:
</p>

<p>
"I'm so pleased you're going to the service, lad," the
hermit said.  "Oh, there's nothing like a life on the
ocean wave, and I've sailed the seas so long that
dearly do I love it.  I'm gladder still to think that
from the pile I made at the gold-diggings and pearl
fisheries, I can make you a comfortable allowance.
Bah! what is the dross to me, and it will be all yours
when I am gone."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't talk of death, Daddy; though you are
gray you are not old."
</p>

<p>
"Well, no, I cannot as yet give myself airs about
my age, but I'm wearing on.  But to business, lad.
The examination is a stiff one."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Daddy.  But won't I study just; and I'm sure
I'll pass even in history, though I hate it.  I'll read up
like fun."
</p>

<p>
"There won't be much fun in it.  But I'll coach you
in French anyhow.  You are right as to age for eight
months to come.  Well, of course your old Daddy will
get your outfit.  And as they give no pay to cadets in
the <i>Britannia</i>, but demand £75 a year, I'll make it
£85."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thanks, dear Daddy!"
</p>

<p>
"Fain would I go south with you, but I shall not
leave my island for some time yet.  Don't imagine I
am going to be downright unhappy,&mdash;because I sha'n't
be.  Your friend Archie M'Laren will bring me all I
want off from the shore.  Fishermen will often visit
me, and your minister M'Ian.  Then I shall have my
fiddle, and, last but not least, our dear doggie here.
We'll both miss you, but I shall think of you every
time I gaze into his loving eyes."
</p>

<p>
If a bomb-shell had suddenly burst over the hut it
would have had a far less stunning effect upon poor
Creggan than the hermit's last words.  Would he,
after all, have to go away without his doggie?  Had he
looked at Oscar for even a moment, he would have
burst out crying like a girl.
</p>

<p>
He just gazed into the fire for a few minutes in
silence, then rose.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be back in a very short time, Daddy," he said.
"And shall I light the beacon?"
</p>

<p>
"Do, like a good lad."
</p>

<p>
Creggan went out into the clear and starry
summer's night.
</p>

<p>
A great round moon had just arisen, and was casting
a broad triangular light across the sea, the apex down
there close to the island, its base on the far-off horizon.
How calmly it shone!  It seemed a holy light.  But
neither moon nor the bright silvery stars could soothe
our young hero then.
</p>

<p>
He lit the beacon almost automatically and
afterwards paced up and down for five minutes or over,
then stood by the beacon resolved and firm.
</p>

<p>
A brave boy now&mdash;a hero, indeed!
</p>

<p>
"I'll do it," he said half-aloud.  "Oh, how I should like
to take my Oscar with me, but I shall not, cannot!
I'll suffer myself rather than let dear kind Daddy
suffer."
</p>

<p>
He felt easier now and happier, and returned smiling
to the hut; and the hermit played and sang for an
hour at least.
</p>

<p>
There was a kind of incubus at Creggan's heart
when he awoke next morning, and for a time he could
not quite make out what it meant.  Then all at once
he remembered his doggie.  The recollection came so
suddenly back to him that at first he was nearly
crying.  But he jumped out of bed, and lightly dressing
went down the cliffs with Oscar to enjoy his morning
swim.
</p>

<p>
Then back to breakfast.
</p>

<p>
Well, you know, reader, "sorrow may endure for a
night but joy cometh in the morning".
</p>

<p>
It did.  For that very forenoon a humble friend of
Creggan's&mdash;Archie&mdash;came off in a shore-boat, bringing
a long letter for the hermit, and a childish but loving
scrawl from Matty to Creggan.  He put that carefully
away, and determined to take it to sea with him.
</p>

<p>
He certainly was a romantic boy, and this is not to
be wondered at seeing the wild life he led, the wild
scenery around him, and the voice of the sounding sea
ever changing and ever telling him something new.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the hermit had read the letter he jumped
up and took Creggan's hand.
</p>

<p>
"This is from Nugent, dear sonny, and he is going
to get leave to let you have Oscar with you."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no, no!" cried the boy.  "He must stay
with you and make you happy."
</p>

<p>
"And I say 'no, no, no!'" replied the hermit, laughing
now.  "Go he shall; I have my bird, my cat, and
my violin.  Oh, believe me, boy, I shall be happy
enough till you come back to see me."
</p>

<p>
And so it was decided.
</p>

<p>
Archie was but a crofter's son, but he was a
particular friend of Creggan's, and they used to be
constantly together before the Nugents came, fishing,
shooting, or wandering over the hills and far away.
</p>

<p>
Archie thought that Creggan was very clever, and
laughed inordinately at all the stories he made up and
told him while they lay together on the cliff-top, where
the wild thyme grew.  It was here they used to meet,
and Archie always brought his dambrod (draughts)
with him.  He had made it himself, and together in
the sunshine they used to play for hours and hours.
They had no real men, only bits of carrots and parsnips
to represent the black and the white, and as Archie
was a far better player than Creggan, he always
removed a few men from his own side before the game
began.
</p>

<p>
But Archie could play chess as well, and always
solved the problems given in the weekly papers, which
the minister kindly lent him.  Creggan had no patience
with so deep a game.  Life, he appeared to think, was
too short for chess.  Well, so far I believe he was right,
for in studying for an exam. one wastes brain power by
playing so difficult a game.
</p>

<p>
Poor Archie was just a year or two older than
Creggan, but over and over again, as they used to lie
together on the wild-thyme cliff, he would say with
all the ingenuousness and frankness of youth:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Creggan, you don't know how much I love you,
and I'll just cry my heart out when you go away."
</p>

<p>
Ay, and there wouldn't be a hut in which there
would be no sorrow, when our young hero went to sea.
</p>

<p>
By the way, I may mention just one thing to prove
the genuineness of the old hermit's kindness.
</p>

<p>
Archie had a brother called Rory, a tall yellow-haired
sturdy young fellow, but somewhat of a doll.
The father was dead, the two boys tilled the small
croft and tended the cows; but somehow Rory took
it into his head to enlist.  Some recruiters came
marching through the parish with kilts and plumes and
ribbons fluttering in the wind, and they marched off
with Rory and some other young fellows too.
</p>

<p>
Well, that same evening Archie met Creggan near
the manse.
</p>

<p>
His eyelashes were wet with tears.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, man!" he cried, "what will we do?  Rory has
gone off with the soldiers.  Oh, come and see poor
mother!"
</p>

<p>
Creggan went at once, and entered the hut.  Such
grief he had never witnessed before.  Among the ashes
by the fireside, with little on save a petticoat, sat Rory's
distracted mother, her gray hair hanging dishevelled
over her shoulders, and her body swaying to and fro
constantly in the agony of her sorrow.  She was
mourning in the Gaelic.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my son, my son!  Oh, Rory, Rory, love of my
heart, my Rory!  Oh, heaven look down and help me!
Rory, Rory, will I never never see you more!"
</p>

<p>
Her face was wet with tears and covered with ashes.
</p>

<p>
She was still sitting there when Creggan left at
eight o'clock, still swaying her body, still mourning,
mourning, and mourning.
</p>

<p>
And when Creggan returned early next day there
was no change.
</p>

<p>
There she sat, as she had sat all night long, among
the ashes, still swaying to and fro, still plaintively
calling for Rory.
</p>

<p>
"Love of my heart, my Rory, will you never, never
come again?"
</p>

<p>
Ah, but Creggan had glorious news for her.  "Cheer
up, dear mother," he said, showing her shining gold,
"I am going to Portree to bring your Rory back."
</p>

<p>
And Creggan, with the hermit's money, did buy the
foolish lad off, and Rory never left his mother more
until she was laid in the quiet churchyard beside the
blue and rolling Minch.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
</h3>

<h3>
ON BOARD THE GUNBOAT <i>RATTLER</i>.
</h3>

<p>
Creggan Ogg M'Vayne worked very hard indeed
to make sure of passing.  I am quite certain
of one thing, that did any lad study so hard in a city,
burning perhaps the midnight oil and sitting in a
badly-ventilated, stuffy room, although at the examination
he might make quite a good show, still "his face
would be sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought".  He
could not be in good health; and I have known
many a boy who, bright in intellect, was too weakly
to "pass the doctor", as it is called.
</p>

<p>
But it was all so very different with Creggan.
</p>

<p>
There is no more bracing or healthy island in the
world than Skye, and during the summer, and all
throughout the autumn till the "fa' o' the year", his
study was out of doors.
</p>

<p>
On fine days it was always on that green-topped
cliff where the wild thyme grew.  I verily believe,
and Creggan himself used to think so, that the song
of the sea as the waves broke lazily on the brown
weed-covered boulders, far beneath the cliff, making
a solemn bass to the musical cry of the gulls, the
kittiwakes, and skuas, helped the lad along.  It lulled
him, soothed him, so that his head was always clear
and his mind never too exalted.
</p>

<p>
City students often need a wet towel to tie around
their brows when at work.  Creggan needed none
of that; his bonnet lay near him, on Oscar's ear, and
the cool and gentle breezes fanned his brow, so that
hard though his "grind" undoubtedly was his face
remained hard and brown, with a tint of carmine on his
cheeks.
</p>

<p>
On stormy days even, he did not go indoors, for
M'Ian the minister knew the value of fresh air, and
had a kind of summer-house study built in his garden
for his son and daughter, Rory and Maggie, and
Creggan.
</p>

<p>
Both were very fond of Creggan.  In fact, being
brought up together, they were like brother and sister
to him, in a manner of speaking, and well he loved
them in return.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
But the winter itself wore away at last.  And
a wild tempestuous winter it had been.  There were
weeks at a time when Creggan could not leave his
little island home, for the seas that tumbled and heaved
around, and surged in foaming cataracts high up the
sides of the black and beetling cliffs, would have sunk
the stoutest boat that was ever built.
</p>

<p>
But Creggan had not been idle for all that.  There
had come a six weeks' spell of calm, clear, frosty
weather, with seldom a breath of wind or cat's-paw to
ruffle the glassy surface of the smooth Atlantic rollers.
So high were these "doldrums" at times, that when
Creggan's skiff was down in the trough of the seas as
he rowed manfully shorewards, there were long seconds
during which Rory and Maggie, watching his progress
eagerly, could not see him.
</p>

<p>
Then, when he mounted a house-high wave, they
would rejoicingly wave their handkerchiefs to him,
and he his bonnet to them.
</p>

<p>
Yes, winter flew far away back to the icy Arctic
regions on snow-white wings, and soft gentle spring
returned, laden with bird and bud and green bourgeon
to scatter over hill and brae and moorland.
</p>

<p>
And next came Creggan's time to start for the far
south to face his examiners.  I shall not linger over
the leave-takings.  He departed with many blessings,
and many prayers would be prayed for his success.
M'Ian kindly accompanied him to Portree and saw
the steamer off.  Then the boy was all alone in the
world, because for the time being he had left even
poor sad-eyed Oscar with Daddy the hermit.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Creggan was bold enough to take the journey all
by himself&mdash;by steamer to Glasgow, by train to Leith,
and by steamer again to London.  He had been recommended
to a small but comfortable hotel, and here he
took up his abode till the exam. days came round.
Of course everything in London streets was strangely
foreign to Creggan, and very confusing.  He didn't
like it.  The twangy jargon of the guttersnipe boys
grated harshly on his ear; the streets were thick in
greasy mud; all aloft was gloom and fog, and never
a green thing about.
</p>

<p>
"I'll do my best to pass well," he said to himself as
he left one day to be present at the examination;
"I'll do my best to pass, but I sha'n't be sorry if I
don't."
</p>

<p>
There were other boys trying to enter the Navy
creditably, and though many were bold, handsome
English lads, most were pale, nervous, and frightened.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
About a week afterwards Archie M'Laren's boat
might have been seen driving over the Minch towards
the island.
</p>

<p>
The hermit knew from his face that he was the
bearer of good tidings.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah, sir!" he cried, waving a letter aloft.
"I've had one myself.  Creggan has passed with
more marks than anybody.  Aren't you joyful, sir?"
</p>

<p>
The hermit, as he rapidly read Creggan's schoolboyish
caligraphy, was indeed too joyful to speak,
and I'm not sure but that his eyes were moist with
tears.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Before going to sea, of course, Creggan had to put
in time on board the <i>Britannia</i>, and after that to be
further examined.  He was a great favourite with
the other cadets, and a noisy, joyous lot they were,
brimful of fun, commingled with a modicum of
mischief.
</p>

<p>
At long last he was appointed to a small ship, and
this was an ironclad too.  He didn't like her.  This
wasn't his idea of a ship.  She lay at Sheerness; and
he didn't like Sheerness either, and I never knew
anyone who did.
</p>

<p>
But the <i>Rattler</i> was only a gunboat, and bound for
the African shores.
</p>

<p>
Now Creggan was a brave lad, so he took a step
that few boys would have dared to take.  He went to
visit Captain, or rather Commander Jeffries at his
hotel.  He found that gallant gentleman lingering
over dessert.  A very tall and handsome man, with
a jolly, smiling face, but exceedingly stout.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my lad," he said, "come in and bring yourself
to anchor.  You're one of the <i>Rattler's</i> middies,
aren't you?"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-080"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-080.jpg" alt="&quot;WELL, MY LAD, YOU'RE ONE OF THE 'RATTLER'S' MIDDIES, AREN'T YOU?&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;WELL, MY LAD, YOU'RE ONE OF THE 'RATTLER'S' MIDDIES, AREN'T YOU?&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Have a glass of wine, my lad.  No?  Better without.
But what can I do for you?"
</p>

<p>
"If you please, Captain Jeffries, I have a lovely
gentle collie dog.  Can I take him to sea?"
</p>

<p>
"I love dogs, my lad, and would gladly have your
collie.  But," he paused and laughed till the glasses
rung, "a curious thing has happened.  I cannot go to
sea in the <i>Rattler</i>, and another officer must be
appointed in my place."
</p>

<p>
"May I ask, sir&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'll tell you the 'why', and it is just here
where the smile comes in.  I am too big to get below,
through the companion, and I couldn't remain on
deck all the cruise, you know.  I've had a deal of
correspondence and red-tapery already about it.  'You
must take up your appointment', said their lordships.
I wrote a few days ago saying plainly 'I sha'n't',
adding, 'What's the use of a commander taking a ship
if he can't get more than just his legs below'."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said Creggan smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Well, at last they are going to appoint another
officer, and I'm sorry to tell you, my lad, that Captain
Flint, who is what we call a kind of sea-lawyer, and
pretends to know everything, hates both dogs and
music.  I'm sorry for you, boy, but keep up your
spirits.  Your ship won't be more than two years out,
and when you return, owing to the splendid show
I hear you made at your examinations, you'll be
entitled to apply for any ship you like, and if I'm in
England call on me and I'll put you up to the ropes.
There, good-bye.  Keep up your heart, my lad, and
you'll do well."
</p>

<p>
Creggan walked briskly and quickly towards the
pier; he was determined he would not give way for
anything.
</p>

<p>
Just two years after this we still find the <i>Rattler</i>
cruising about the west coast of Africa, and despite its
unhealthiness there was no extra sickness on board
and no fever.
</p>

<p>
Captain Flint was really a good sailor, but snappish
and ill-natured.  He bullied everyone around him, and
often punished his men and boys severely.
</p>

<p>
Under such a commander it is almost needless to say
that Creggan's life was not altogether a happy one.
However, he did his duty, and did it with method and
precision.  He was so strong and healthy that there
was no one on board that ship who could make him
nervous.  But he used to pity some of his messmates
who, though a year or two older, were smaller and less
bold than he.  Both the first and second lieutenants
were real good fellows, but this little fiery-haired,
ferret-eyed commander, or skipper, as all hands plainly called
him when out of hearing, cowed even these.
</p>

<p>
I do not suppose that Flint could help himself, and it
is always best, I think, to say all one can for even bad
men.  Now, whisper&mdash;the commander's wine-cellar was
far too big for him.  I do not think anybody ever saw
the little man intoxicated, on deck at all events, but
that curse of our nation&mdash;alcohol&mdash;made him crabbed
and peevish, and he did not care then whom he insulted.
</p>

<p>
One or two instances of how Flint carried on may
serve to show my readers what a tyrant even the
commander of a Royal Navy screw gunboat may
make himself, on a lonely coast like that of the
western shores of Africa.
</p>

<p>
Please remember that I am not depending on my
imagination for my facts, the experiences were my
own.
</p>

<p>
The surgeon of the <i>Rattler</i>&mdash;and there was but one&mdash;for
the craft was only 800 tons, was a sturdy Scot,
who did his duty, and did not care a pin-head for
anyone.  His very independence annoyed Flint.
</p>

<p>
"I'll bring that saucy Scot to his senses," he said
one night to his first lieutenant, who was dining with
him.
</p>

<p>
The first luff, laughing, told the doctor next morning
that he was to be brought down a peg, and asked him
how he would like it.
</p>

<p>
The surgeon&mdash;Grant, let us call him&mdash;merely laughed
and said quietly:
</p>

<p>
"It won't be that little skin-Flint that will do it.
Why, Lacy, I could take him up with one hand and
hold him overboard while I shook his teeth out into
the sea.  I could mop up the quarter-deck with him,
then stand him on his head on the top of the capstan."
</p>

<p>
Everyone laughed, because everyone liked the surgeon.
</p>

<p>
But as the commander had said he would make the
surgeon haul down his flag, he determined to act, and
went to bed grinning to himself.
</p>

<p>
The persecution began next morning.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
WAR AHEAD!
</h3>

<p>
The skipper was on the bridge near the quarter-deck
next morning, when the surgeon tripped up
the ladder, saluted, and handed him the sick-list book.
</p>

<p>
"What!" shouted Flint.  "Fifteen on the sick-list, sir,
out of a small crew like this?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What's the meaning of it, sir?  What's the meaning
of it?  I've been in a line-of-battle ship with no more
on the list than this."
</p>

<p>
"The cases, Captain Flint, are chiefly coast ulcer.  I
do my duty, sir, and it will go hard with anyone who
denies it.  And it is also my duty, sir, to inform you,
that if you continue to get into red-faced rages,
like that from which you are now suffering, you will
before long have a fit of apoplexy."
</p>

<p>
"When I want your valuable advice, Dr. Grant, I
will send for you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Captain Flint.  Delighted, I'm sure!"
</p>

<p>
The captain took a turn up and down the bridge.
</p>

<p>
Then returning to the charge:
</p>

<p>
"Is there any hygienic measure you could suggest
for the removal of this ulcer plague?" he roared.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, the place where the sick lie is as hot and
stuffy as the stoke-hole.  I'd like screen-berths on
deck."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, have my quarter-deck by all means!"
</p>

<p>
The commander was talking sarcastically now, of
course.
</p>

<p>
But the surgeon's chance had come.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir," he cried, laughing in spite of
himself.  Then he wheeled, and was down below before
Flint had time to utter another word.
</p>

<p>
Now, the little man dearly loved his quarter-deck.
He was king there; a sea-king and monarch of all he
surveyed.  Well, he was in the habit of taking a
sleep-siesta every afternoon, as soon as luncheon was over.
And this was the surgeon's time.  He got the carpenter
and his mate to remove their shoes, and put up the
screen-berths and hang the hammocks as silently as
moles work.  Then the worst cases were got up and
put to bed.
</p>

<p>
It was really very nice for them, because they could
look at the blue sparkling sea, get fresh air, and watch
everything that went on around them.  When the
skipper came on deck, he was fain to catch hold of a
stay to prevent himself from falling.  So at least the
quarter-master said.  But he himself had given the
order, and as the surgeon had obeyed it, nothing could
now be done.
</p>

<p>
Two days after was the Sabbath, and before divisions
the commander and first lieutenant, accompanied by
Surgeon Grant, walked round the ship and down below
to inspect.  As usual, those of the sick who could
stand were drawn up in single file.  Now, the skipper
ought to have asked the surgeon, not the men, about
their complaints, only Flint was still intent on bringing
the doctor low.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with you, my man?  And what
is the surgeon giving you?"
</p>

<p>
"It is my business to answer that question, sir,"
said the surgeon angrily.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not talking to you, doctor."
</p>

<p>
Grant said nothing.  He simply lifted his cap,
wheeled about and walked on deck.
</p>

<p>
His flag wasn't down yet.
</p>

<p>
The war went on.
</p>

<p>
Next morning a boy was, by the captain's orders,
introduced to the gunner's daughter for some trifling
offence.  This means that without being undressed, a
boy is tied breast-downwards to a gun, and in this
position receives a rope's-ending.
</p>

<p>
The doctor was walking the quarter-deck laughing
and chatting with a messmate, when the commander
advanced.
</p>

<p>
"Surgeon Grant," he said, "attend to that boy's
flogging."
</p>

<p>
Now, if a real flogging[<a id="chap10fn1text"></a><a href="#chap10fn1">1</a>] or "flaying match" had to be
played, and a man&mdash;guilty of some great crime&mdash;was
stripped to the waist and tied to the rigging to receive
four dozen with the cat, not only the doctor, in cocked
hat and lashed to his sword, but all the officers and
crew as well would have to be piped up to witness
this fearful punishment.  But it was no part of the
surgeon's duty to attend a boy's birching.  That
indeed would have been <i>infra dig</i>.  So, on this occasion
the surgeon simply gave Flint a haughty stare, then
continued his conversation.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap10fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap10fn1text">1</a>] Flogging is now done away with in our Navy.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Why, this is insubordination, sir!  I've a good mind
to put you under arrest."
</p>

<p>
Then, as the bo's'n's mate expressed it, "the doctor's
dander riz".  But he kept his temper.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Flint," he said, "you can put me under
arrest if you please, but I shall not lower the dignity
of a profession which is as honourable as yours by
attending a boy's rope's-ending."
</p>

<p>
The commander stamped and paused.
</p>

<p>
"I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;" he began.
</p>

<p>
"Now, now, now," cried the surgeon, "you'll have a
fit!  I warn you, sir.  You're short-necked, sir, and
excitable, and if&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He got no further.
</p>

<p>
"Confound you, sir, I'll pay you out for this!"
</p>

<p>
Then he rushed below.
</p>

<p>
But there was nothing done about it.  Flint simply
nursed his wrath to keep it warm.
</p>

<p>
One day, some time after this, the ship grounded on
a sand-bank.  Luckily it was at low tide, so when the
tide began to rise, all hands, even the officers, had orders
from the commander to arm themselves each with a
56-lb. shot, and rush fore and aft, and aft and fore, in a
body to help to swing the ship off.
</p>

<p>
But Grant stood quietly by the binnacle.
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear the order, sir?" roared the commander.
"Get your shot and join the crew."
</p>

<p>
"Na, na, na," answered Grant, in his native Doric.
"Man, I've gotten a laddie's back to see till, and a
poultice to mak.  Jist tak' a shot yoursel', man."
</p>

<p>
On this occasion the captain had to smile.
</p>

<p>
But the war culminated about a month after this,
and on that occasion, it must be confessed, the doctor
did lose his temper, and had the captain been able to
get witnesses he could have tried the surgeon by
court-martial, for Grant's conduct amounted almost to
mutiny, albeit the provocation he received was very
great.
</p>

<p>
You cannot insult a Scot more than by attempting
to throw mud at his country.
</p>

<p>
Well, while anchored near a village the officers
generally went on shore in mufti, and Grant was in the
habit of wearing a Scotch Glengarry bonnet (called a
cap by the English).
</p>

<p>
Now it occurred to the commander that he might
give the surgeon a knock-down over this.  So he called
the assistant paymaster, and ordered him to write
what is called "a memo.", which is really a tyrannical
edict, which all the officers, however, must sign.
</p>

<p>
Flint dictated the memo., and when presented to him
for inspection, it read as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>MEMO.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>It is my directions that the officers of this ship
shall go on shore dressed as gentlemen.</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This would have been insult enough to poor Grant,
but the skipper added to it greatly, for between the
words <i>as</i> and <i>gentlemen</i> he wrote the word <i>English</i>,
making the memo, read as <i>English gentlemen</i>.
</p>

<p>
The doctor was writing in his cabin, between which
and the commander's saloon there was only a single
bulkhead.  He was the last officer to be asked to sign
the memo.
</p>

<p>
When he read it, then indeed his "dander riz".
</p>

<p>
His fury was fearful to behold, and the commander
could hear all that was said.
</p>

<p>
Grant sprang to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"This from Flint!" he roared; "and he dares ask me
to sign it!  Is not a Scotch gentleman as good as an
English gentleman any day?  See here, Maxwell, I
tear it in pieces, and fling them on the deck.  Take it
back to him thus if you choose, but he shall not insult
my native land!"
</p>

<p>
At this moment the commander was heard shouting:
</p>

<p>
"Quartermaster!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Send Dr. Grant to my cabin at once."
</p>

<p>
Grant required no two biddings.  He rushed up the
ward-room companion and thundered down the captain's
stair, while officers, quartermaster, and all rushed
forward, determined not to be witnesses to anything
that might happen.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps never on board a man-o'-war before did
such a scene take place in a commander's cabin.
</p>

<p>
Grant had picked up a handful of the torn-up
memo., and quickly now drawing back Flint's curtain
he stood like an angry bull in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
The skipper started to his feet.  He had been
sitting in his easy-chair.
</p>

<p>
"Sir&mdash;" he began.
</p>

<p>
But he got no further.
</p>

<p>
"You sent this memo. to me?  There!  I fling it at
your feet.  I ought to fling it into your white and
frightened face.  How dare you insult my country,
sir?  You little tippling whipper-snapper!"
</p>

<p>
"This is rank mutiny!" cried the skipper.  "I'll
call the first lieutenant and quartermaster."
</p>

<p>
"You may call till you are hoarse, and they will
not come to witness against me.  Even your boy has
fled, and now I'll speak my mind."
</p>

<p>
Here the commander attempted to run the blockade
and force his way out.
</p>

<p>
"Stand back, sir," cried Grant, "or worse will
happen!"
</p>

<p>
"Now, sir, listen to me.  I have stood your tyranny
long enough and as calmly as I could, and now it is
my turn, and I tell you plainly that whenever and
wherever I find you on shore in plain clothes, I'll
give you such a thrashing that you won't forget it the
longest day you live.  Good-morning."
</p>

<p>
This ended the scene.
</p>

<p>
Some captains would have shot Grant where he
stood.  But Flint was terror-stricken and silent.
</p>

<p>
He was on deck again half an hour afterwards,
looking as if nothing had happened.
</p>

<p>
Next evening the steward came in to say, with
Captain Flint's compliments, that he wished Dr. Grant
to come and share a bottle of wine with him.
</p>

<p>
"Tell the captain, with my compliments, that I
refuse."
</p>

<p>
That was the answer.
</p>

<p>
The steward returned in three minutes' time.
</p>

<p>
"The captain wants to see you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, certainly; that is an order."
</p>

<p>
And off he marched to obey it.
</p>

<p>
When he entered Flint stood up, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid, doctor," he said, "I've been too hard.
Are you willing to let bygones be bygones?"
</p>

<p>
Who could have resisted an appeal like this?  It
was as nearly an apology as any captain could make
to a junior officer.  And he held out his hand as he
spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Willing," cried Grant with Scotch enthusiasm, "ay,
and delighted!  You know, sir, I'm only a wild
Highlander, so I lost my balance when&mdash;but there, never
mind.  'Tis past and gone for ever and for aye."
</p>

<p>
Then there was a hearty handshake and both sat
down.
</p>

<p>
"There is the wine," said the commander, "and
there is the whisky."
</p>

<p>
"I'll have the whisky," said Grant, "though not
much.  But it is the wine of my country, sir."
</p>

<p>
The commander smiled, and Grant drew the cruet
towards him, quoting as he did so and while he tapped
the bottle, the words of Burns:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When neebors anger at a plea,<br />
  And just as wud[<a id="chap10fn2text"></a><a href="#chap10fn2">2</a>] as wud can be,<br />
  How easy can the barley-bree<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

[<a href="#chap10fn2text">2</a>] Wud=angry.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Some time after this the commander fell ill, and so
kind was Grant to him, and so constant in his
attentions, that all animosity fled for ever, and Flint
really got fond of Grant, whom he delighted when
visiting on shore to call "my surgeon".
</p>

<p>
Well, whatever ill-feeling officers or men may
exhibit toward each other if penned up in a small mess,
when war comes it is all forgotten, and the British
sailors and marines, when sent on shore to fight, stand
shoulder to shoulder, and woe be to the foe who faces
them.
</p>

<p>
One day, while lying off Loanda, startling intelligence
came to the commander of the <i>Rattler</i> from
a steam launch that had been despatched in all haste
to hurry her up to the mouth of the Benin river.  A
party of European traders, many British as well as
foreign, had been surrounded and massacred to a man.
The steam launch belonged to H.M.S. <i>Centiped</i>, a
cruiser far larger than the <i>Rattler</i>.  The officer in
charge could hardly stop to eat or drink, but food was
handed over the side, and in ten minutes' time she was
once more under weigh and steering rapidly north.
</p>

<p>
A glance at a map of Africa will show you that
Loanda lies well to the south of the Bight of Benin,
and show you, too, where the great river Niger or
Quorra empties itself into the Gulf of Guinea.
</p>

<p>
All was now bustle and stir on board the <i>Rattler</i>.
Steam was ordered to be got up at once.  There used
to be disputes between the engineer and captain, but
these were all forgotten now.
</p>

<p>
Would you believe it, reader, that all hands, from
the commander to the dark-skinned Kroomen from
Sierra Leone, were as merry and happy as if they
were going to a fancy ball instead of to battle and to
carnage.  Such is your British sailor.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was ordered half an hour sooner, so that
the men should have plenty of time to get their arms
and accoutrements into perfect fighting trim before
the sun went down at four bells in the first dog-watch.
</p>

<p>
The captain felt in fine form; for whatever faults
he had, he certainly was no coward.
</p>

<p>
He liked his middies well, too, when he had not
those nasty little fits of bad temper on.  To-day he
walked up and down the quarter-deck holding our
hero Creggan by the arm, and not only talking to
him but encouraging the boy himself to talk.
</p>

<p>
Creggan was nothing loath.  But from some words
he let fall, Commander Flint found he had a romantic
early history.
</p>

<p>
"You must come and dine with me to-night," he
said, "and tell me all your story.  You and Dr. Grant."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you, sir.
</p>

<p>
"And now," added Creggan, "may I take the
liberty of asking you just one question?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Mr. M'Vayne, certainly."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, do you think we shall have a real battle
with the savages?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure to, and perhaps half a dozen.  The case
seems very grave, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll be glad to see some fighting."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!  And now you can go and tell the steward
I want him."
</p>

<p>
Off went Creggan, and next minute up popped the
steward.
</p>

<p>
"Sir?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Splice the main brace," said the commander.
</p>

<p>
(This means, reader, an extra glass of rum to all
hands.)
</p>

<p>
By this time the <i>Rattler</i> was ploughing her way
through the bright blue sea, and heading for the
north.
</p>

<p>
Exciting adventures were before them.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
THE CITY OF BLOOD
</h3>

<p>
"In the city of Benin," said the commander, that night
at dinner, "and all around it, westward to Dahomey,
Abomey, and Ashantee, they are a bad lot, an accursed
lot, treacherous and cruel to a degree."
</p>

<p>
"I've heard it said," Creggan ventured to remark,
"that the men of Benin are not brave, Captain Flint."
</p>

<p>
The captain shook his head and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"We must not believe all we hear.  Remarks like
these are generally made by gentlemen journalists who
live at home at ease.  But I've been there, lad, and
found it altogether different."
</p>

<p>
The dinner passed off very comfortably indeed.
Dr. Grant would not touch wine, but when dessert had
been removed, and the commander ordered the steward
to bring in the tumblers, he helped himself somewhat
liberally to the wine of his native land.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Captain Flint," he said, "I haven't really
been a dog's watch[<a id="chap11fn1text"></a><a href="#chap11fn1">1</a>] in the service, as you might say,
and with the exception of a brush with the Arabs on
the East Coast of Africa, and north of the Equator,
I've never seen what we in Scotland term 'solid
fighting'."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap11fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap11fn1text">1</a>] The dog-watches are from four to six and six
to eight every evening,
and therefore only two hours long,
while all the others are four hours.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I think you will have a chance now, doctor."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, sir; and I won't begrudge flailing around with
the claymore a bit, and seeing my patients afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"Tell us something about Benin, sir, if you please,"
said Creggan.
</p>

<p>
"Well, lad, I've told you that the people are fearful
savages when aroused, although seemingly quiet enough
at all other times.  Benin, you know, is really a
country extending to Ashantee.  Once exceedingly powerful,
and densely populated still, it is now divided into
many half-independent states.
</p>

<p>
"The city itself lies nearly eighty miles up the river
Niger, from the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Guinea.  It
is about twenty miles inland.  This river is miles wide
where it joins the sea, and if you once get over the bar,
it may be cautiously navigated by boats and launches
nearly all the way up.  But there is the dreaded bar to
cross.  What are those lines, lad, about Greenland's icy
mountains?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know," said Creggan, holding up one arm as
if he were a school-boy.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'From Greenland's icy mountains,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From India's coral strand;<br />
  Where Afric's sunny fountains<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll down their golden sand.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Is there a lot of golden sand, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"There is a lot of constantly shifting black-brown
mud, but if you expect to find gold or see it, you'll be
sadly disappointed.
</p>

<p>
"The city itself contains from twelve to twenty
thousand natives, as well as I could guess.
</p>

<p>
"The king is a savage emperor of the deepest and
blackest dye.  His reign is a reign of terror.  He rules
his unhappy subjects with rods of iron and knives of
steel.  I hope you'll never see what I have seen there.
The sight of those human sacrifices, boy, would return
to your dreams for years afterwards.  They do to mine,
whenever I am ill or troubled."
</p>

<p>
"You saw them, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I was despatched on a mission of peace, one might
say.  I had a body-guard of fifty armed men, and
blue-jackets and marines, and had need been, we could have
fought our way to our boats through all the king's
fanatics.
</p>

<p>
"The mission was this.  You must know that all the
coast-line is British, and the people at home were
constantly being shocked to hear of the terrible human
sacrifices occurring in Benin, while it was nothing
uncommon to find a mutilated and headless corpse, that
the sharks had spared, cast up with outspread arms on
the beach."
</p>

<p>
"Terrible!" said Dr. Grant.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  And my mission was not to take revenge, but
to endeavour pacifically to get the king to give up
those massacres of men, women, and helpless children,
for whom he had no more pity than the self-named
sportsmen who follow the Queen's hounds have for
the innocent and hunted stag.
</p>

<p>
"The king was amply supplied with bad rum or
arrack, the worst and most fiery of all spirits.  He got
this stuff from the palm-oil traders of Gato, men who
came from Portugal and even Britain itself.
</p>

<p>
"He was three sheets in the wind when we arrived
on a beautiful afternoon.  He told us, through our
interpreter, how delighted he was to see us, and how
he would give us a grand show next morning.
</p>

<p>
"We occupied portions of his grass-hut palace, keeping
well together after lying down on grass mats, with
our arms by our sides; for as the king had got drunker
and drunker, and was now yelling and whooping like
a madman, we feared he would make an attempt to
murder us all before morning.
</p>

<p>
"You see, Creggan, that cutting throats was a fancy
or fad of this brutal monarch's, just as collecting foreign
stamps is with most English boys.
</p>

<p>
"All around the back part of the palace lay bleaching
skulls and skeletons, that the blue-bottle flies and
ants had polished, and recent corpses also, from which
so fearful a stench arose and poisoned the air that we
could scarcely sleep.
</p>

<p>
"But I fell off at last, and the sun was shining over
the dense forests of the East before I awoke.
Something was going on behind.  Something dreadful, I
felt sure.  There was a low and pitiful moaning, but
no cries.  Yet every now and then came a dull thud,
similar to that which a butcher makes in splitting a
pig in two.
</p>

<p>
"I peeped through the back wattled wall.  Oh, lad,
may you never see such a sight!
</p>

<p>
"Over fifty poor creatures were huddled together
mournfully awaiting their doom.  Every half-minute
one was dragged out, and stood with his or her hands
between the knees and head bent down, till the cruel
blow fell that severed that head from the body.
</p>

<p>
"But three or four were crucified in another corner.
</p>

<p>
"My remonstrances were in vain.  The king only
laughed, and told me that it was all got up in my
honour.
</p>

<p>
"As no more could be done, we left almost immediately.
We regaled ourselves on fruits as we passed
on through the jungle to our sailor-guarded boat, and
glad enough were we all when we found ourselves
rowing once more down the beautiful river, on each bank
of which&mdash;alive with beautiful birds&mdash;the foliage and
trees were like the forests and woodlands of fairyland.
</p>

<p>
"But," continued the commander, "to change the
subject to one more pleasant, tell us the story of your
young life, my lad."
</p>

<p>
Nothing loath, Creggan told the doctor and him all
he knew from his babyhood, and all about the hermit
also.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it is a perfect romance, Creggan," said Flint.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed it is," said Grant.  "I'll take more interest
in the lad now than ever."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Arrived at the mouth of the Niger, they found the
<i>Centiped</i> anchored outside the bar.
</p>

<p>
She was not going to venture across, being too large.
</p>

<p>
On the bar itself the breakers were dashing and
curling house-high.  There was just one gap in the
centre, and through this the saucy <i>Rattler</i> must force
her way.
</p>

<p>
Before proceeding she was lightened as much as
possible, that is, all men not required were sent on
board the cruiser.
</p>

<p>
Then "Go ahead at full speed", was the order.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Rattler's</i> full speed was nothing very
extraordinary, but when she reached the gap at last and
entered it, poor Creggan felt appalled.  The roar of
a seeming Niagara at each side was so terrible, that
even through the speaking-trumpet scarcely could the
skipper's voice be heard.
</p>

<p>
The roar was mingled with a seething, hissing sound,
which was even more deafening than the thunder of
the breakers itself.
</p>

<p>
She bumped her keel several times on the bottom,
which here was hard, so violently that the men were
thrown down, and Creggan began to say his prayers,
thinking the ship must undoubtedly become a wreck.
Nevertheless, in a minute or two they were into the
deep smooth water inside the bar.  Here she was
anchored for a time, until all the marines and
blue-jackets of both ships were got on board the <i>Rattler</i>.
The boats and steam launch would accompany the
expedition, and after all were loaded up with armed
men, the advance was made up stream.
</p>

<p>
It was now about two bells in the forenoon watch,
and they expected to get up as high as it was possible
before night.
</p>

<p>
This it was found impossible to do, so she was
anchored, and next day succeeded in reaching a station
some forty miles from the sea, called Sapelé.  This in
launches, the gun-boat being left further down.  Here
to their joy they found a fort or barracks, containing
in all about two hundred and fifty officers and men
(soldiers).
</p>

<p>
The expeditionary force from the <i>Rattler</i> was soon
landed and hailed with delight.  Together they were
now quite a strong little army.
</p>

<p>
The commanding officer told Captain[<a id="chap11fn2text"></a><a href="#chap11fn2">2</a>] Flint a sickening
story of the massacre of the traders.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap11fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap11fn2text">2</a>] A Commander in the Royal Navy is not
in reality a captain, but is
usually addressed so by courtesy.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The king, in fact," he said, "is jealous of the
approach of the Protectorate."
</p>

<p>
After the murders he, the officer, had sent a
sergeant with a flag of truce and several Kroomen, to
ask for an interview with the tyrant.
</p>

<p>
Two days afterwards the white sergeant dragged
himself, wounded and half-dead, into barracks.  Before
he expired, poor fellow, he had only time to report that
every Krooman was murdered, and that Benin was in
a state of terrible ferment, like a hive of hornets.
</p>

<p>
"And so, Captain Flint," he added, "between your
force and mine, I think we can give this murderous
assassin such a drubbing that he will not forget it for
years."
</p>

<p>
"We'll do our best," said Flint; "and I suppose the
sooner we start the better."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly; it is always wiser to attack than wait
to be attacked."
</p>

<p>
So it was determined to give the little army a
hearty supper, let them turn in early, and ready to
start by three, inland now through the jungle, towards
Benin.  The real distance from Sapelé to Benin is, I
believe, about twenty-five miles, but the road, if road
it could be called, was bad enough in all conscience.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, it was determined to drag along two
guns, with a good supply of shell.  The bugle sounded
prettily over woods and dells and river, shortly after
two, and on finishing their hurried breakfast the force
fell in.
</p>

<p>
Very proud indeed was Creggan to be allowed to go
along with it, armed not only with a good cutlass,
instead of the almost useless dirk, but with a revolver.
</p>

<p>
This was indeed a forced march, for before four
o'clock next day they had got within twelve miles of
the dismal city, with only one halt to partake of food,
although much wood had to be cut down.  They
immediately hewed trees and bushes and went into
laager, expecting an attack at any moment.  When as
safe as could be, fires were lit and supper cooked.
Under other circumstances they would have remained
silent and in the dark, but the commanding officer
well knew that long before this time the blood-stained
king would have heard of their advance.  So, no
attempt at concealment was necessary.
</p>

<p>
But the men were tired, so soon after supper fires
were banked, and in an hour's time there was hardly
a sound to be heard in the laager.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Grant and Creggan were the last to stretch
themselves on their pallets of grass.  Grant in his own
wild Highland home had been used to roughing it, and
Creggan, as we know, led a very active life on the
Island of Wings.  So neither felt tired.
</p>

<p>
The night was balmy with the odour of many gorgeous
wild flowers, and it was even cool.  The moon
shone like a disc of gold, high up near the zenith,
dimming even the effulgence of the brightest stars, and
casting a strange, dreamy, phosphorescent light over
the shapeless masses of cloud-like trees, and a brighter
glimmer on the tall feathery cocoa-nut palms.  Now
and then away in the woods, there arose the mournful
cry of some bird of prey, a cry that would make the
marvellously beautiful king-fishers crouch lower to
the perches on which they sat, and thrill their hearts
with terror.
</p>

<p>
Now and then a fleecy, snow-white cloudlet would
sail gently over the moon's disc, making the light
scenery momentarily dimmer, but soon all was
brightness once more.  From an adjacent creek at times
would come the sound of a heavy plunge, but whether
from ghastly crocodile or hippopotamus they could
not tell.
</p>

<p>
"It is indeed a goodly night," said Grant.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is heavenly!" cried Creggan; "but will we
all be alive this time to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Who can tell, my lad?  No one dies till his day
comes.
</p>

<p>
"But," he added with some hesitation, "you're not
afraid, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no indeed, doctor; just a little anxious, that
is all.  This will be my first fight, you know.  But
I am seventeen now&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and hard and strong, Creggan."
</p>

<p>
"So, doctor, if I get a chance to hit a nigger, I
mean to hit him just as hard as I know how to."
</p>

<p>
"Very good.  So shall I; but let me give you a word
of good advice, because I'm older than you.  Don't get
carried away by excitement.  He fights best who
fights as calmly as possible.  Keep to the fighting line
or square, as the case may be, and you'll do well.
</p>

<p>
"And now I think I'll turn in, and may God in his
mercy preserve us both to-morrow, and our Captain
Flint as well."
</p>

<p>
"Amen!" said Creggan.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
In less than half an hour after this Creggan was
fast asleep, and dreaming that he was bounding over
the smooth waves of the blue Minch in his skiff, with
poor honest Oscar in the bows, and bonnie wee
fair-haired Matty in the stern-sheets all smiles and
dimples, her eyes twinkling with fun and merriment.
</p>

<p>
The dream seemed a very short one.
</p>

<p>
"Surely," he said, when the bugle sounded, "I
cannot have slept an hour."
</p>

<p>
Yet it was already half-past one, and the moon
had westered and was slowly sinking towards the
horizon.
</p>

<p>
Before two breakfast was finished, a ration of rum
served out, and the march resumed.
</p>

<p>
They must walk silently now.
</p>

<p>
The road was better, so that under the light of the
stars only, for the moon had sunk, they had reached
the wide straggling city by five o'clock.
</p>

<p>
Here the forces separated, the marines and blue-jackets
lying in wait in a piece of jungle in the east;
the soldiers making a silent detour to the back of the
city, where was a dense primeval forest.
</p>

<p>
The guns were a long way behind, but just as the
sun was tipping the glorious clouds of palms with its
crimson rays, they were dragged in.
</p>

<p>
The sound of one gun and a bursting shell was to
give notice to the soldiers hidden in the forest that
the battle had indeed begun.
</p>

<p>
Just as the sun cast his bright beams across the
darkling forest a buzz of awakening life began to
arise from the city.
</p>

<p>
A spy had informed the naval commander where
the king's forces, to the number of five thousand at
least, were concentrated.
</p>

<p>
He now pointed out the very spot, a kind of fort
and eminence in the centre of the town, and not far
from the awful blood-stained palace.
</p>

<p>
"Now, gunner," cried Captain Flint cheerily, "give
us the best shot ever you fired in your life."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do my level best," was the reply.
</p>

<p>
There was no quaver in the man's voice, no quiver
in his hand.
</p>

<p>
The gun rang out in the morning air, echoed and
re-echoed from forest and brae, and the shell was
planted right in the centre of that heathen fort,
bursting, and evidently doing tremendous damage.
The battle had begun.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
CAPTURE OF THE CITY OF BENIN.
</h3>

<p>
There is nothing that African savages dread more
than shells and war-rockets, and Arabs themselves
are equally demoralized by these dread missiles.
</p>

<p>
They care but little&mdash;I am talking from my own
experience&mdash;for ordinary round shot, if they are any
distance off, in their dhows.  From the cruiser's black
side they can see arise a white cloud of smoke, with a
spiteful tongue of fire in the centre; in a few seconds
they hear the roar of the gun, and see the shot itself.
</p>

<p>
Well, they but utter a word of prayer to Allah, and
ten to one the shot goes hurtling past high overhead,
or it doesn't reach, but goes ricochetting past, half
a mile astern perhaps, taking leaps of fifty yards at
a time, throwing a cloud of foam up from every wave
it strikes, till at last it sinks down to the slime of the
fathomless sea.
</p>

<p>
If a cannon ball comes near enough to dash the
sea-spray inboard, the Arab captain curses the British
as heartily as he prays for himself, though he keeps
cracking on.
</p>

<p>
But the shells, ah! the shells, that hiss and hurtle
and fly into splinters in the air above the dhow,
scattering death and destruction along its decks and
poop; they will not yield to prayer, and I never yet
saw an Arab captain who would or could stand the
brunt of three or four well-aimed ones.
</p>

<p>
If one of these shells hit a mast, even if you are
unwounded, the fall of that spar is something
terrorizing to look upon, with its tangled rigging as
well.
</p>

<p>
It does not come down quickly; it quivers and reels
uncertainly for a time, while you gaze upwards and
probably utter involuntarily a helpless moan.
</p>

<p>
It is coming down on you, and how can you escape
death?  More quickly, more and more quickly now, it
descends.  Then there is a crash, smashed bulwarks,
and splinters flying in all directions.  But, you are
safe after all!
</p>

<p>
Captain Flint and his men had a good supply of
shells, and it was lucky that the guns got up in time
and were not damaged, for during the march there
had been many small streams to cross, in which it was
difficult at times to find a ford.
</p>

<p>
What wild yelling and shouting comes from the
city now!  Were it a large, compact town, with high
houses and towers, Flint would shell it.  But it were
a pity to expend a shell in knocking a few grass huts
to pieces, and scaring, killing, or wounding, perhaps,
only helpless women and children.
</p>

<p>
"Just one other startler, sir,&mdash;shall I?"
</p>

<p>
The tall, dark young gunner was as good a shot as
ever drew lanyard, and he told a messmate before he
addressed the commander that he was spoiling for a
shot or two that would astonish the weak nerves of
the niggers.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Gill," said Flint smiling, "just one other;
but I want to spare the ammunition till we see the
foe."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Br&mdash;br&mdash;brang!</i>" went the gun a few seconds
after, and the great shell went shrieking away on its
mission of death.
</p>

<p>
Louder yelling than before followed the bursting of
this shell.
</p>

<p>
Still the enemy did not appear.
</p>

<p>
Some men would have stormed the town, and
attempted after a rifle volley or two to take it at the
bayonet's point.
</p>

<p>
But this Ju-Ju king, with his naked feet caked
with the blood of the victims that he had walked
among, had a force of fiendish soldiers at least ten
times greater in number than Flint's sailors and the
soldiers behind.  With these the king over-awed the
the neighbouring states, and carried fire and spear
and sword into their midst if they owned not his
superiority and greatness.
</p>

<p>
Two hours passed away and still they did not show
face, though the blue-jackets were stamping on the
ground, and itching to get at them.  Waiting for a
tight makes the bravest sailor or soldier nervous.
</p>

<p>
The cause of the delay was that Benin, being
completely under the dominion of a set of bloodthirsty
scoundrels of priests, there were fetishes or oracles to
be consulted, and all kinds of mumbo-jumbo business
to be gone through, before the Ju-Ju king's army could
come forth.  Oh, as for the king himself, his person was
far too sacred to risk.  The priests told him so, and he
was by no means loath to believe it.  Besides, he was
so covered with beads from chin to ankle, that he had
some difficulty in walking much.
</p>

<p>
Far better to stay in his harem, and listen to the
yelling of his soldiers, the rattling of the musketry,
and roar of the guns, until, as the priests assured him
would be the case, the British prisoners&mdash;all that
were not slain&mdash;should be brought in.
</p>

<p>
Ah! then, he said to himself, the fun would begin.
He would roast some alive.  "Man meat", as these
cannibals call human flesh, which, by the way, is sold
openly in the market-place, is ever so much more
tender and juicy when cooked alive.  Well, the king
made up his mind to roast a few; he would torture
and crucify others on trees, with widely-extended
arms and legs, and wooden pegs nailed through the
flesh of feet, legs, and arms to hold them up.  Others,
again, he would tie to stakes, where he could see them
starve to death in the broiling sunshine, half-eaten
alive at night by loathsome beetles and other fearful
insects.  All the rest he would either behead, or hand
over to the women to be tied down and slowly
disembowelled alive!
</p>

<p>
That was the programme.
</p>

<p>
And now it was to be carried out.  So the king
believed.  The British tars and marines were well
stationed on slightly rising ground, half-sheltered by
straggling bush, and were all ready when the enemy
appeared in his thousands.
</p>

<p>
Mercy on us, how they yelled, and waved aloft shield
and spear or guns, as they came on like a black and
awful avalanche!
</p>

<p>
They fired first, and a few of our fellows fell, but
only wounded.
</p>

<p>
"Reserve your fire, lads, till they get nearer!" cried
Flint, for the blood of the sailors was getting hot.
</p>

<p>
Still on came that yelling avalanche.  The sailors
could see their red mouths, flashing teeth, and fearful
eyes, when the captain shouted:
</p>

<p>
"Aim low, lads.  Fire!"
</p>

<p>
That was a splendid volley!
</p>

<p>
Its effects were startling.  The enemy was packed
together, and some of the British bullets must have
killed or wounded two at a time.  It was followed up
by others quite as good, and the dark skins, kicking
and squirming like wounded rats, blackened the ground
as their comrades sprang past or over them.
</p>

<p>
Nor did the hissing, spluttering war-rockets, tearing
through their centre, repel their determined advance.
</p>

<p>
It seemed for a time that win the battle they must,
by mere force of numbers.
</p>

<p>
Their terrible yelling now increased.  All savages
make these sounds, which they believe paralyses the
enemy.  Our brave Jacks and Joes, however, don't
paralyse worth a groat.  They were now formed into
squares for a time, which the Ju-Ju's devils could
not break.
</p>

<p>
Revolvers did lovely work!
</p>

<p>
Again and again the black savages advanced, only to
be hurled back.
</p>

<p>
Then they threw their spears.
</p>

<p>
This was nasty, and wounded many of the man-o'-war's men.
</p>

<p>
"Fix bayonets!" cried Flint.
</p>

<p>
The bayonets were really cutlasses, and our fellows
know how to use them too.
</p>

<p>
"Charge!"
</p>

<p>
How our men cheered, as they dashed on to the
work of death!  A true British cheer.  The king heard
it and trembled.
</p>

<p>
For a time it was a hand-to-hand tussle.  But look
yonder, in a more open space the captain himself has
fallen, and three armed savages are on him instantly;
two have spears&mdash;one is about to dash Flint's brains
out with the butt-end of a beggarly Brummagen gun,
when in the nick of time Creggan, who is near at
hand, fires, and the fellow, with arms aloft, falls dead.
Then, cutlass in hand, our hero rushes at the other two,
as did the wild cat at his neck on that starlit night long
ago, when he was returning home with dear Matty by
his side.  He has cut one across the neck with terrible
effect, but the very strength and impulse of the blow,
somehow, makes poor Creggan stumble and fall.
</p>

<p>
Next moment savage No. 3 has a spear very near
to his chest indeed.
</p>

<p>
Yes; but the captain has now sprung up,&mdash;he was
merely stunned,&mdash;the spear is splintered with the first
blow, the second cleaves the savage's skull through to
the eyes.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, boy," cried Flint, "for your timely
aid!  I'll not forget it."
</p>

<p>
And blood-dripping hands are shaken there and then.
</p>

<p>
But how goes the battle?
</p>

<p>
Ah! right bravely.  You can tell that by the royal
cheers of Jack and Joe.
</p>

<p>
The foe reels backwards, wavers, flies.  No use for
blue-jacket or marine to follow.  These fiends run
swift as deer!
</p>

<p>
But shells and war-rockets do dread work now, and
sadly thin the ranks of those shrieking fiends.
</p>

<p>
Nor is it all over yet.  For look, right in front of
the defeated and fleeing army there suddenly springs,
as if from the earth itself, a thin red line of British
soldiers.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rip&mdash;rip&mdash;rip</i> go the crackling rifles all along this
line.  As pretty platoon firing as one could wish to
see or hear.
</p>

<p>
And the effect is deadly.  The black army bids fair
to be wiped out.  They attempt to fly to the right&mdash;to
the left.  But Flint has divided his little army and
outflanks them on both sides.  Then, cowed and
appalled, those among them who are still intact throw
away their arms, throw themselves on the ground,
throw themselves even across the bleeding bodies of
the slain, and shriek aloud for mercy.  Mercy?  It is
never refused by British soldiers to beseeching foemen.
</p>

<p>
The carnage has been dreadful, but silence reigns
now, except for the pitiful moaning of the wounded.
No sound of rifle, no slash of cutlass, or hiss of flying
spear!
</p>

<p>
A blue sky above, and bright sunshine, in which the
woods around seem to swelter and steam.  The blue
above&mdash;the blood below!
</p>

<p>
Yes, readers, war may be glorious, but it is after the
battle has ceased to rage that one sees Bellona[<a id="chap12fn1text"></a><a href="#chap12fn1">1</a>] in all
her dreadful deshabille, her blood-stained arms, her
soaking hair, and cruel and fiercely flaming eyes.
May heaven in its mercy keep war and famine far
away from our own sweet island home!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap12fn1"></a>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
The arms were now taken from the prisoners, and
they were left huddled together like an immense herd
of seals, for all were lying down exhausted.  Only
fifty men were left to keep them together.  The main
little army then marched into the city.
</p>

<p>
Will it be believed that women and children rushed
to meet our heroes, kneeling in the dust and weeping,
embracing our blue-jackets' knees, till more than one
tar was heard to remark: "I'm blessed, Bill" (or Jim
as the case might be), "I'm blessed if I don't feel like
blubbering my blooming self."
</p>

<p>
For the British sailor, though the bravest of the
brave in battle, has ever a tender heart to a child
or woman.
</p>

<p>
But there was one particular cry that rang all
through this poor forlorn mob.  When translated it
was found to mean:
</p>

<p>
"Kill the devil&mdash;Oh, kill the devil-king!"
</p>

<p>
The awful odour of this blood-stained city cannot
be described.  Nor can the sights that were seen in
the market-place and around the palace.  The skulls
set on sticks, the skeletons, the putrid bodies; the
crucified men still rotting on the trees, their heads
fallen down till the chins touched the breast-bone;
the "man-meat" in joints left on the now deserted
stalls, the joints not unlike those of black pig.  But
the most disgusting sight of all, perhaps, was to see
naked black children squatting on the murdered dead
or drumming on their chests with the bones of the
skeletons.  And there was, as Burns says, in his
inimitable <i>Tam o' Shanter</i>,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Mair o' horrible and awfu',<br />
  Which ev'n to name wad be unlawfu'".<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
What a surprise his sable Majesty got when our
blue-jackets, to the number of twenty, stormed his
harem!
</p>

<p>
He had expected his own warriors, with British
heads to set on poles, with British joints to roast for
dinner, and British men to torture and burn.
</p>

<p>
Tom Sinclair, of the <i>Rattler</i>, a beau-ideal seaman,
led the rest.  His white "bags", as he called them,
were red and brown with blood, and his shirt
besprinkled too.  But his sun-tanned face looked as
jolly as if he had only just come from a ball instead
of a field of carnage.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Yambo sana!</i>" (a Swahili salute).
</p>

<p>
"<i>Yambo sana!</i>" he said to the king, who was
stretched on a raised, mat-covered couch.  "W'y,
what a luxurious old cockalorum you are, to be
sure!"
</p>

<p>
Tom hitched up his trousers as he spoke, and looked
pleasant.
</p>

<p>
But like fire from flint the Ju-Ju king sprang up,
and attempted to knife poor Tom.  And Tom with a
single twist disarmed him, and next moment the king
in his beads was lying on his back, the blood flowing
from his nasal organ.
</p>

<p>
Tom was as calm as a judge.
</p>

<p>
"'Xcuse me, old chap," he said, "for making your
morsel of a nose bleed.  Would have preferred giving
ye a pair of black eyes, only they wouldn't show like,
your skin's so dark.
</p>

<p>
"Seems to me," he added, "yer soul's as black as yer
blooming skin.  Wouldn't I like to trice yer Majesty
up and give ye four dozen.
</p>

<p>
"Here, interpreter," continued this tormenting Tom,
"'terpret wot I says to this ere himage o' Satan.  Are
ye ready?"
</p>

<p>
"Tell him that we've wiped out his sodgers, and ask
if he could oblige us by turning out a new army.
We were only just a-settlin' down to serious fightin'
when the beggars bolted.
</p>

<p>
"Told him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sah.  And now he groan and shake his big
head plenty mooch, for true!"
</p>

<p>
"Tell him not to be afeard, that we won't scupper
him (kill him) for a day or two, but that we means
only to put a hook through his nose and 'ang him to
a branch.  Have you got a grip o' that, 'terpreter?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sah.  And see, he shake his big head once
more.  Hoo, hoo!  How he make me laugh!"
</p>

<p>
"Tell him that we may also build a fire under him
just to keep his toes warm, 'cause it would be a terrible
thing if a monarch like he was to catch his death
o' cold."
</p>

<p>
The interpreter had barely finished telling the
trembling king all this, when a stir in the after
part of the room announced the arrival of the
commanding officer, Fraser, and Captain Flint.
</p>

<p>
The sailors fixed bayonets, and drew silently up.
</p>

<p>
Then Colonel Fraser, through the interpreter, sternly
ordered the king to stand up, and just as sternly
addressed him.  Pointing out to the assassin the enormity
of all his fearful crimes, and what his punishment
might be, if he, the commanding officer, cared to go to
extremes.  He told him much else that need not be
mentioned here.  But the palaver thus begun did not
end for days.
</p>

<p>
The soldiers and sailors meanwhile commanded a
large body of niggers to go everywhere over the town
and bury every human carcase, and even every bone.
The market stalls were heaped around the crucifixion
trees and fired.  The trees themselves burned fiercely.
</p>

<p>
The king's special murder-yard was also seen to.
Then a grass and bamboo house was run up for the
king in a different part of the town.  To this he was
escorted, laughed at and jeered by women and children,
while his old blood-stained palace and everything in
it was burned to the ground.  Many of the adjoining
huts caught fire, but the conflagration, though at night
it looked very alarming, did not extend far, and was
soon got under by the natives themselves throwing
earth over it.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
In another week's time the brave little army was
once more on the march back to the river at Sapelé.
</p>

<p>
But the king had almost emptied his treasures of
gold-dust to pay the demanded indemnity; he agreed
also to send to New Benin much ivory, copal, nutmegs,
and spices and palm-oil.  A treaty was signed (it has
not been kept, by the way) which bound his Majesty
down to discontinue the awful human sacrifices, and
to rule his subjects peacefully, on pain of another
invasion by British forces, who next time, the
commanding officer informed him, would hang him on
the nearest tree and annex his country.
</p>

<p>
Just before the sailors and soldiers commenced
their march to the river a strange and curious thing
occurred.
</p>

<p>
There came emissaries from the hill tribes of the
Wild West seeking an interview with Colonel Fraser.
</p>

<p>
The men, who were as wild-looking as any savages
ever seen, and armed with spears and strong shields,
looked nevertheless far from unpleasant.
</p>

<p>
The colonel was found after a little delay, and then
the interpreter.
</p>

<p>
The first thing these strange men did was to lay
their spears and their shields at the colonel's feet,
then they grovelled, head down, in the dust, which, as
they muttered some strange words, they mingled with
their bushy heads of hair.
</p>

<p>
"Tell them to rise," said Colonel Fraser.  "I cannot
spare long time in ceremony."
</p>

<p>
The savage emissaries arose at once and stood
before him.
</p>

<p>
"What can I do for you, my men?" said the commandant.
</p>

<p>
Their answer was so voluble that even the
interpreter could not for a time understand it.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
IN A WILD AND LOVELY MOUNTAIN-LAND.
</h3>

<p>
I believe, reader, that human nature is pretty
much the same all the world over.  The motto,
"Don't sit on a man when he is down", is strictly
adhered to, only the word "don't" is always deleted.
And when a man is down, physically, morally, or
financially, people, even old "friends", do sit on him,
just as a cabby sits on his fallen horse's head to keep
him down.
</p>

<p>
There is hardly any such thing as extending a
kindly hand to a fallen man to help him up again,
or even giving him a word of encouragement which
might save his life itself.  He is simply ostracized.
</p>

<p>
But in very truth there was considerable excuse for
those hillmen from the Wild West.  That blood-stained
Ju-Ju king had ruled them with a rod of
steel, ravaged their country, killed the men who
could not escape, and carried off their women and
children.
</p>

<p>
And now their time had come.  The trampled worm
had turned, and their proposal was simplicity in itself.
It may best be expressed in the interpreter's own
words.
</p>

<p>
"Dese gentlemans," he began, as he pointed to the
niggers, and Creggan and some other officers smiled
aloud; "dese gentlemans come from de far-away
mountain.  Plenty cold sometimes up dere.  Dey want to
bringee down five, ten tousand warrior to help we.
Dey kill all, all dey men-men, take away de women-men
and de little chillen.  All de men-men dey eat
plenty quick, and dey will nail de debil-king to a
tree, all spread out, and roast he alive, for true.  De
king, when all nice and plopah, dey give to you to
gobble up."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Fraser had a hearty laugh over this, then
he made a short speech, in which he said he did not
see his way at present to accede to their request, but
if they would promise not to attack the king till he,
Colonel Fraser, returned to punish him again, he
would accept their proposal, but was not quite certain
that he would eat the king, even if he were done to
a turn.
</p>

<p>
Then with his own hands he returned to them
their spears and shields, and, bowing and salaaming,
thanked them.
</p>

<p>
Those emissaries of a poor oppressed race went
back to their mountains rejoicing, and the march to
the river was at once commenced.
</p>

<p>
They carried the wounded and even the dead in
hammocks.  Had they buried the latter anywhere
near Benin they would, Colonel Fraser thought, be
speedily disinterred and eaten.
</p>

<p>
In the woods, ten miles from the City of Blood,
they buried their fallen comrades, after Colonel Fraser
himself had said a prayer&mdash;not a printed one, but an
earnest prayer from his honest, kindly heart.
</p>

<p>
Many a tear trickled down the cheeks of the
blue-jackets and marines as comrade after comrade
was laid side by side in the deeply-dug trench, while
such expressions as the following were heard on
every side:
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Bill, we'll never see you more!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Joe, you and I 'as spent many a 'appy day
together.  Farewell, old man, farewell!"
</p>

<p>
"Jim, if I thought a pipe 'ud comfort ye, I'd put all
my 'baccy beside ye in the grave.  Blest if I wouldn't,
messmates!"
</p>

<p>
Rough but kindly words, and not without a certain
degree of pathos.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
There was no need to hurry back; so, after crossing
a creek about ten miles from the river they bivouacked
at Siri, a wretched village, for the night.  But the
inhabitants had heard of the battle, and the downfall
of the assassin king, and brought them presents of
fruit and cassava, besides nutmegs and spices, for all
of which they were substantially thanked with gifts
of coloured beads, which made the sable ladies chuckle
and coo with delight.
</p>

<p>
Next day the expedition reached the river and
crossed to Sapelé, and soon after the sailors reached
their ship.
</p>

<p>
But they had not quite done with Benin yet.  The
wounded soldiers had been safely seen to at Sapelé,
but the colonel and a Lieutenant Aswood boarded
the <i>Rattler</i> to dine with Flint and his officers, and
considering everything, a very jolly evening was
spent.  The doctor had reported that the wounded
would all do well, so Commander Flint gave a
dinner-party, and orders to splice the main brace, from
the gun-room aft right away forward to the cook's
galley.
</p>

<p>
There was jollity, therefore, forward.  Yarns were
told, songs were sung, and every now and then the
sweet music of guitar and fiddle floated aft.
</p>

<p>
It was for all the world like an old-fashioned
Saturday-night at sea.
</p>

<p>
And those in the saloon or commander's cabin, including
the soldiers, the ship's doctor, first lieutenant,
and Creggan, felt very happy indeed.  The chief talk
naturally centred on the recent fight, and the terrible
condition of the City of Blood.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Flint, as far as niggers go I'm not a bad
prophet."  This from the colonel.  "And I'll tell you
what will happen."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Fraser," said Flint, "heave round and give
us your ideas."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, I'm half-sorry now that I didn't hang
that blood-drunkard of a king to begin with.  But
the king that the priests would have then placed on
the stool called a throne might have been quite as
bad, if not worse."
</p>

<p>
"True, Fraser, true."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think he will be influenced by that treaty?"
</p>

<p>
"About a week, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Just so."
</p>

<p>
"On the other hand," said the colonel, "I am
half-sorry I didn't allow the mountain-men to wipe the
savages out.
</p>

<p>
"But," he continued, "that Ju-Ju monarch is no
more to be restrained from sacrificing his subjects than
a cat could be from catching sparrows.  Now he'll go
on till he gets hold of some whites and massacres
these.  Then there will be another war.  If we do not
kill the king, he'll be sent down to the coast and
imprisoned for life."
</p>

<p>
"I follow you," said Flint.  "What next?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, annexation of course, and the whole of this
rich and lovely country will become ours.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think of its healthiness?" he added,
turning to Dr. Grant.
</p>

<p>
"Give a dog a bad name," replied Grant, "and you
may kill him as soon as you like.  When we annex
this land of Benin, the niggers under our kindly
sway&mdash;and they swarm in millions, you know&mdash;will till it
and drain it for us; cut down useless jungles, fell
valuable timber, which will help to dry up the creeks
and bogs.  All unhealthiness will then vanish, sir,
like the morning mist from the mountain tops; land
will be cheap and good, and colonists will come from
Scotland by the shipload.  As for sickness, we shall
have splendid sanatoriums far away among those
lofty mountains, where the climate must be temperate,
and even bracing."
</p>

<p>
"Capital, Dr. Grant!  Capital!  Just my own ideas,"
said the colonel, "only expressed in far prettier
language than any I could use.  And now, Flint, what
say you to stay for a week here, while we explore
the country as Moses did the Holy Land?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Colonel Fraser," cried Creggan laughing, "it
wasn't Moses, but Caleb and Joshua.  Poor Moses only
had a bird's-eye view of it from a hill-head, you
remember."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, boy, and thank you.  Well, Flint,
suppose you and I on this occasion go and spy out
the land, which must eventually be ours, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Good!" said the commander.  "We shall go in
peace, and with peace-offerings for the people."
</p>

<p>
"Beads and bonnie things," said Grant, with a broad
Scotch smile.
</p>

<p>
"That's it, doctor," said the colonel.  "Beads and
bonnie things.  But an escort as well, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, fifty marines and blue-jackets."
</p>

<p>
"And start to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Capital!"
</p>

<p>
"And now, Grant, I know you sing and play.  Yonder
is the piano; sit down and delight us."
</p>

<p>
Grant required no second bidding.
</p>

<p>
After a most charming prelude he said smiling:
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to sing you songs of the triune
nation&mdash;Scotland, England, and Ireland."
</p>

<p>
And so he did.
</p>

<p>
After a beautiful, sad, and plaintive Scotch song, he
rattled off into a strathspey and reel.  After singing
"<i>Good-bye, Sweetheart, Good-bye</i>", he played a waltz,
and on concluding "<i>The Harp that once through
Tara's Halls</i>", he dashed off into such a soul-inspiring,
maddening, droll old jig, that everybody all
round the table clapped their hands and shouted
"Encore!"
</p>

<p>
Well, on the whole, the evening passed away most
delightfully, but by eight bells or the end of the first
watch, all on board save those on duty were sound
asleep in hammock or cot.
</p>

<p>
The exploration of the country was commenced
next day.  Tents were not taken, but tins of potted
meats, and potted vegetables.  They would sleep
beneath the stars in open ground.  Rum was also
taken, but it was mixed with quinine.
</p>

<p>
The explorers were fifty-and-six all told, including
Creggan and Dr. Grant.  Creggan, being a mountaineer,
proved himself invaluable.  He was so light to run,
too, and went on ahead here, there, and everywhere,
even shinning up trees to find out the best roads.
</p>

<p>
The people they encountered were none too gentle.
They even looked askance at the presents.  So Colonel
Fraser decided not to make use of any as guides, for
fear of being led into an ambush.
</p>

<p>
When they came at last to&mdash;altering Scott somewhat&mdash;a
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Land of green heath and shaggy wood,<br />
  Land of mountain and of flood,<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
the forests grew denser, darker, and deeper.  The
roar of wild beasts, too, was heard by day as well as
by night, so that caution had to be used.  And here
were many lakes, though there were streams instead of
creeks.  And these lakes were literally alive with
fish.
</p>

<p>
"Beautiful!  Beautiful!  What a happy hunting-ground!"
exclaimed Fraser, as two strange deer went
past like the wind.
</p>

<p>
"It is indeed a land flowing with milk and honey,"
said the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"And all to be ours.  All to be British!"
</p>

<p>
They passed the forests safely enough, and now got
fairly into the mountain-land.  Here were glens, as
bonnie and bosky as any in Scotland.  They entered
one particularly beautiful dell.
</p>

<p>
They had paused to admire and wonder, when the
distant sound of war-drums or tom-toms fell upon
their ears, and presently a huge band of savage warriors
appeared, as if by magic, on the opposite brae.  So
suddenly did they spring up, that the brave lines
of the poet came back with a rush to Creggan's
mind.  Yonder, of course, were no waving tartans or
plumes.  Yet that dark army rose from the bush in
the same startling way.  It is in Roderick Dhu's
interview with the Saxon Fitz-James on the Highland
hills.  Roderick cries:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Have, then, thy wish!'  He whistled shrill<br />
  And he was answered from the hill;<br />
  Wild as the scream of the curlew,<br />
  From crag to crag the signal flew.<br />
  Instant, through copse and heath, arose<br />
  Bonnets and spears and bended bows;<br />
  On right, on left, above, below,<br />
  Sprang up at once the lurking foe;<br />
  From shingles gray their lances start,<br />
  The bracken bush sends forth the dart;<br />
  The rushes and the willow-wand<br />
  Are bristling into axe and brand,<br />
  And every tuft of broom gives life<br />
  To plaided warrior armed for strife.<br />
  That whistle garrisoned the glen<br />
  At once with full five hundred men,<br />
  As if the yawning hill, to heaven<br />
  A subterranean host had given."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Why," said Colonel Fraser, pointing to the hillside,
"just look yonder, Flint.  We don't want to fight these
poor hill-men.  They are doubtless the same from
whom the emissaries came."
</p>

<p>
"Well, anyhow," said Flint, "they look as vicious
as vipers.  Let us send our interpreter over at once.
He will explain things."
</p>

<p>
"Good!"
</p>

<p>
So this was done.
</p>

<p>
But it was evident that the hill-men were not open
to reason, for the poor fellow was immediately seized
and bound.
</p>

<p>
"Now," cried the colonel, "we must and shall
advance.  If there were twice five hundred we should
not submit to that indignity."
</p>

<p>
So the little brave band proceeded at once to descend
the hill and ford the stream.  Bayonets were fixed,
and all were climbing slowly up the steep brae on
the other side, but a long way to the right, in order
to get higher than the threatening savages and thus
have all the advantage, when wild whooping and yells
arose above them.
</p>

<p>
They could not understand this, until down rushed
the guide and interpreter&mdash;a free man.
</p>

<p>
"All right, sah, all right!  De men who come to
Benin, dey am dere now, and all de oder sabages am
plopah fliends now.
</p>

<p>
"Come on!  Come on!" he added.
</p>

<p>
And on they went.
</p>

<p>
They were received by the hill-men with shouts
of joy, and one tall, very black savage, much
ornamented with feathers and beads, insisted on taking
Colonel Fraser's hand, and bending low over it
touched it with his brow.  He repeated the same
ceremony with all the officers, then waved his dark
hand in quite a dignified way to the blue-jackets
and marines.
</p>

<p>
Strange to say, he could even talk a little English.
</p>

<p>
"I am please, I am mooch delight," he said.  "At
Gwato I meet plenty goot trader, ah! and plenty vely
bad.  Ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
The officers laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, chief, we have thrashed the cruel king of
Benin, and now we want to see your dear mountain-land,
because one day we shall kill the Ju-Ju king,
and then the kind-hearted Great White Queen shall
reign over you, and you will be all very happy."
</p>

<p>
"I guide you, I guide!  Be delight,&mdash;plenty mooch
delight!"
</p>

<p>
So, high up into the mountains marched the sailor-band,
with the chief and twenty savages as guides.
</p>

<p>
It was getting late now, but before sunset they
arrived at a mountain village, the huts of which seemed
to be perched upon the shelves of the rock, like eagles'
eyries.
</p>

<p>
They found the village clean and sweet.
</p>

<p>
The chief took the officers into the largest hut,
which he had caused to be rebedded with withered
ferns, while the couches all round were made of
beautiful heaths, intermingled with wild flowers.
</p>

<p>
Then Creggan and the gunner went out to see to
the men's supper, and found them all contented and
jolly.
</p>

<p>
When he returned, lo! a banquet of fried fish, sweet
potatoes, roast yams, capsicums, and fruit of many
kinds, was spread on boards or pieces of bark before
his shipmates.
</p>

<p>
"Take seat, take seat!" cried the chief, "and eatee
plenty mooch foh true!"
</p>

<p>
"Why," said Creggan, as he squatted on the ferns,
"this is indeed a land flowing with milk and honey."
</p>

<p>
It was, and behind each officer kneeled a little girl
with a palm-leaf fan to keep the guests cool.
</p>

<p>
A modicum of rum was served out, and the chief,
Gabo, was asked to drink.
</p>

<p>
He drew back in horror.
</p>

<p>
"No, soldiers, no!" he cried.  "Dat am de debil foh
true.  Sometime we hab plenty from the oil-traders
at Gwato.  Den we all go mad, and mooch kill
eberybody.  Now we nebber look at he."
</p>

<p>
A band of girls came in afterwards, and danced
while they sang.  A strange wild dance it was, with
many wonderful swayings of arms and bodies.
</p>

<p>
An hour after this the British were sleeping soundly.
</p>

<p>
All hands were called just a little before sunrise, and
what a gorgeous sight they beheld!  Only a Turner
could have done justice to that sky of orange gray and
gold, and to the splendid landscape of forest and water
that lay between.  Lake on lake, stream or creek
everywhere, and the purple mist of distance over
all, save where a lake caught the crimson glare of
the sun and was turned into blood.
</p>

<p>
And down beneath them the nearest braes were clad
in a wealth of wild heaths and geraniums, and many
a charming flower hugging the barer patches.  The
officers were silent as they gazed on all this loveliness.
</p>

<p>
"No beauty such as this," said Grant at last, "can
be seen even in Scotland."
</p>

<p>
But every bush seemed to be alive with bird-song,
every leaf appeared to hide some feathered songster;
and when any of these flitted from tree to tree, it was
found that they were quite as beautiful in colour as
the flowers themselves.
</p>

<p>
The air, too, was cool and delightful.
</p>

<p>
Creggan and Grant went for a little walk farther
up the hill, where they found a great basin of rock
filled with clear limpid water, and here they bathed,
so that the appetite both had for the excellent breakfast,
roast wild game, birds, and mountain trout, with,
as before, yams and sweet potatoes, was quite
striking&mdash;striking down, I may say.
</p>

<p>
They all went hunting that day.  But up in the
hills there were few wild animals of any sort, yet
they enjoyed the tramp nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
They stayed with this wild tribe for over a week,
and every day brought them something fresh in
adventure or pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Fraser made sketches, and took many
observations of this beautiful land of wild bird, tree,
flower, and fruit, which at no distant date will become
the possession of the enterprising British colonist, and
give riches to men now starving perhaps in the
overcrowded cities of our island home.
</p>

<p>
Soon may this day come!
</p>

<p>
There is nothing impossible in Africa.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
A FEARFUL NIGHT.
</h3>

<p>
But the scene changes, and will change still more
as this story runs on.
</p>

<p>
Our heroes are back once more in the <i>Rattler</i>, that
only last night bumped out over the bar, and is now
lying alongside the <i>Centiped</i>.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Fraser, of course, has returned to his own
barracks, and the officers of the expedition, including
Creggan, are at dinner on board the larger ship, telling
and talking of all their wild adventures.
</p>

<p>
"Now, gentlemen," said the captain, "I have news
for you, which I would not tell you before, lest it
should spoil your appetites."
</p>

<p>
They all waited to hear it.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Wasp</i>, outward bound for the slave-coast of
Eastern Africa, lay-to here three days ago and sent
a boat with letters for you all."
</p>

<p>
"How delightful!" cried Creggan excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"And, Captain Flint,&mdash;the <i>Rattler</i> is ordered home."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" cried Grant, and there was a general
clapping of hands all round the table, and I'm not
sure but that Creggan's eyes filled with tears.  He
was little more than a boy, remember.
</p>

<p>
Well, the sackful of letters was duly put in the
<i>Rattler's</i> boat when she was hauled up, and that night
everybody on board that saucy gun-boat got good
news&mdash;or bad.
</p>

<p>
Creggan had quite a bunch of letters, which he
read in the gun-room, and again by daylight next
day.
</p>

<p>
That old song keeps running through my head as
I write&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Good news from home, good news for me,<br />
  Has come across the dark blue sea,<br />
  From friends that I had left in tears,<br />
  From friends I have not seen for years.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And since we parted long ago,<br />
  My life has been a scene of woe;<br />
  But now a joyful hour has come,<br />
  For I have got good news from home."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The second line of the second verse is, however,
hardly correct as far Creggan was concerned.  On the
whole he had passed his time very pleasantly indeed,
with some little griefs, of course.  Many a storm had
the <i>Rattler</i> weathered, and many a strange sight had
he seen.
</p>

<p>
He would be entitled to a good long spell of leave
when the gun-boat was paid off, and what tales he
would have to tell the old hermit (his Daddy) and
Archie, and last, though not least, dear wee Matty!
But stay, she would be eleven years old, for Creggan
was eighteen or almost.
</p>

<p>
But here were the letters from home, one each, and
long ones too, from Daddy, Mr. M'Ian, Rory and
Maggie, Nugent and Matty.
</p>

<p>
He kept the latter to the last.  What a dear,
innocent little epistle it was, and though no praise
could be given to the caligraphy, which was a trifle
scrawly, childish, innocent love breathed from every
line.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was a bright and beautiful morning when the
<i>Rattler</i> weighed anchor, left the Bight of Benin, and
steered west and away, homeward bound for Merrie
England.
</p>

<p>
As the gun-boat passed the <i>Centiped</i>, which would
now take her place on this station, there was many
a shout of "<i>bon voyage</i>" from the quarter-deck; the
rigging was crowded with sailors like bees on a bush,
and after three cheers were given, the little band of
the <i>Centiped</i> struck up <i>Home, Sweet Home</i>.
</p>

<p>
The notes came quavering sweetly, sadly over the
water, but soon they died away, and in an hour's time
the ship they had left behind them could hardly be
seen against the greenery of the trees that lined the
Afric foreshore.
</p>

<p>
They made a good run that day, and when, after
the ward-room dinner and gun-room supper, Grant and
Creggan met upon the quarter-deck, steam had been
turned off and the fires banked, for there was just
enough wind to send the <i>Rattler</i> on.  She ran before
it, for it blew off the land, with stunsails set alow and
aloft.
</p>

<p>
It was a delightful night, though not bright, but
the clouds that covered the sky were very high and
gauzy.  They had many a rift of blue, however, and
whenever she had a chance while the clouds went
scudding on, the moon shone down on the sea with
a radiance brighter than diamonds.
</p>

<p>
Now and then a shoal of playful dolphins would go
leaping and dancing past.  It was evident that they
enjoyed the beauty of the night as well, if not better,
than even Grant or Creggan could.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Rattler's</i> record till she reached the Bay of
Biscay, which she skirted only, was really a good one
for a ship of such small horse-power.  Though an
iron-clad, remember, she had sails and rigging as well
as steam.  But now the scene changed!  The glass
went down like falling over a cliff, banks of sugarloaf
clouds rose one evening threateningly in the east,
and it was evident to every seafarer on board that it
was to be a dirty night.  So sails were got in, and the
ship made snug, while the engineer speedily got up
steam.
</p>

<p>
Creggan was in the first mate's watch, and they
had the middle watch to keep to-night.
</p>

<p>
A man had come down below to shake his hammock
and call him.  That hammock required a good
deal of shaking before Creggan was thoroughly
aroused.  But he turned out at once.
</p>

<p>
"Better put on your oil-skins, sir," said the seaman.
</p>

<p>
"Is it blowing, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Hark, don't you hear it roar, sir?  It's blowing
real big guns, Dahlgrens and Armstrongs, all in a heap.
Hurry up, sir!  It's gone eight bells minutes ago."
</p>

<p>
Creggan was not long in getting on deck.  He tied
the flaps of his oil-skin over his ears and under his
chin.  A good thing, too, for the wind was wild
enough to have torn one's hair off.  Creggan could
scarcely stand or stagger against it.  Nor could the
gun-boat make much headway either.  Hardly,
perhaps, a knot an hour.
</p>

<p>
The lad got aft to look at the compass.  Yes, her
head was north and a trifle westerly.  She was boldly
holding her course at all events.
</p>

<p>
It was very dark indeed, for all round the vessel
the horizon was close on board of her, and the inky
clouds must have been miles deep.  The ship's masts
seemed to cut through them when high on the top of
a storm-tormented wave, and when down in the deep
trough between two seas these waves thundered over
the bows and came rushing aft in white foam, a
rolling cataract, which, had the ship not been battened
down, would have flooded the engine-room and
probably drowned out the fires.
</p>

<p>
Creggan was perfectly alive to the extreme danger,
for if the ship from any accident broached to, in
all probability she would turn turtle and be heard of
nevermore, until the sea gave up its dead.
</p>

<p>
Yet Creggan managed to get forward a few yards
to the spot where the first lieutenant stood clinging to
a stay, and they managed to carry on a conversation
for a while.
</p>

<p>
But a kind of drowsiness stole over both, and
presently they became silent.
</p>

<p>
Creggan was awakened from his lethargy by the
crashing of wood forward.  A mighty wave had splintered
the bulwarks, and for just about half a minute
the vessel fell off her course.
</p>

<p>
It was found necessary to put an extra hand to the
wheel.
</p>

<p>
The storm was now at its worst.  Ever and anon the
waves, more than houses high, made a clean breach
over her, the spray dashing as high as the fore-top,
and even down the funnel.
</p>

<p>
To add to the terror, peal after peal of thunder
appeared to shake the ship to her very keel.  Louder
far than the roar of the savage waves was this thunder,
and the lightning lit up the slippery decks, and
showed the men crouching and shivering aft, their
faces like the faces of the dead, while over the ocean
it shot and glimmered till the sea itself looked an
ocean of fire.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, indeed a dreadful night!
</p>

<p>
Neither the first lieutenant nor Creggan was sorry
when they were relieved.
</p>

<p>
The former beckoned the lad into the ward-room.
Then he produced the beef and "fixings", as he called
bread, butter, and the cruets.  Both were hungry, and
between them they made the joint look small.
</p>

<p>
Then Creggan went off to his hammock, commending
himself as he lay down to that God who can hold
the sea in the hollow of His hand.
</p>

<p>
Four hours of sweetest dreamless slumber, and when
our hero went on deck after breakfast, though the
wind had gone down and gone round, the seas were
still high and darkling blue.
</p>

<p>
But it was now a beam wind, so fires were banked,
and she went dancing on her course, as if she well
knew that after all her trials and buffetings she
would soon be safe in Plymouth Sound.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The evening before the <i>Rattler</i> sighted the
chalk-cliffs of Old England Creggan had kept the first
watch, from eight to twelve, therefore he would have
what sailors call "all night in".  That is, he turned
in at twelve, and did not have to leave his hammock
till about half-past seven.
</p>

<p>
On board a ship in harbour, the time youngsters
turn out is five bells.  I slept in a hammock myself
when I first joined, and I assure the reader I didn't
like to be called at five bells, or half-past six; but the
quartermaster was inexorable, he used to pass along
the orlop deck, where all our hammocks hung, and
strike each a dig with his thumb underneath.
</p>

<p>
"Five bells, sir, please!  Five bells, sir, please!"
</p>

<p>
This resounded all along the deck, and if we had
not turned out in five minutes, then he took the
number of the hammock and reported it to the commander.
The owner of that hammock was planked.  That is,
he was brought on the quarter-deck and severely
reprimanded.
</p>

<p>
Our sea-chests stood all round the deck, and as
soon as we got up, our servants folded the bed-clothes,
lashed up the hammocks, and trundled them away
to the upper deck to be neatly stowed in the
topgallant bulwarks.
</p>

<p>
But though we got up, we didn't always, if ever,
begin to dress immediately.  No, we used to mount
to the top of our sea-chests, and with our night-shirts
drawn down to cover the toes, and our knees up to
our chins, squat there for perhaps a quarter of an hour,
looking for all the world like a row of fan-tail pigeons.
</p>

<p>
Then we grew lively, opened our sea-chests, which,
you know, contain a complete toilet service at the top,
washed and towelled, skylarked, stole each others socks,
and pelted each other with wet sponges.  I dare say
our marine servants were to be pitied in their almost
fruitless endeavours to maintain order.
</p>

<p>
Ah! those dear old days are past and gone, and
they will never come again!
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
However, although he had all night in, somehow it
was quite an hour before Creggan dosed off.  He was
reviewing in his mind the events of the cruise, and
thinking of home at the same time, anxiously too.  It
must have been months and months since the last
batch of letters received were written, and some of his
dear friends may have died since then.  This thought
made his heart beat uneasily.
</p>

<p>
Then he remembered that he had hurried into his
hammock without saying his prayers.
</p>

<p>
But he did so now, and so felt more contented and
happy.
</p>

<p>
All the scenes of the past three years then presented
themselves in single file before his mind's eye.  Had
he done all he could for the service?
</p>

<p>
He really thought he had.
</p>

<p>
Poor old Daddy the hermit had given Creggan
three maxims before he left his little island home, and
the lad had always borne these in mind.  They are not
sentimental or namby-pamby, or I would not repeat
them.  They are just good, honest rules, that would
help any sailor-boy to get his foot well on to the first
rung of the ladder that leads to fame and fortune.
</p>

<p>
"My dear sonny," said the hermit, "mind you this,
and mind it all your life:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"First&mdash;If a thing is worth doing at all, it is worth
doing well.
</p>

<p>
"Second&mdash;'Work while it is called to-day, for the
night cometh when no man can work'.
</p>

<p>
"Third&mdash;Try to see your duty and make sure of it,
and when you see it, go straight for it."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
But Creggan dosed off at last, and soon slept soundly
enough.
</p>

<p>
When he got into the gun-room next morning, he
was saluted by his merry messmates in the following
fashion.
</p>

<p>
"Creggan Ogg, hillo!"
</p>

<p>
"Hillo&mdash;o&mdash;o, old Creggan!"
</p>

<p>
"Creggan, ain't you just too awfully glad for anything?"
</p>

<p>
Our hero looked from one to the other in a kind of
puzzled way.
</p>

<p>
"Are you all mad?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no, but we're nearly home, man alive!"
</p>

<p>
"He isn't half-alive!  He isn't awake yet!"
</p>

<p>
Then it began to dawn upon Creggan.
</p>

<p>
He jumped up on the locker, and had a peep out
through the tiny port, or scuttle-hole.
</p>

<p>
Why, it was like looking through a mirror into
fairyland.  The picture was very limited, it is true,
but yonder, high up on a green brae, was a long,
white-washed cottage with a woman at a tub washing
clothes in front of it, and a brindled cow quietly
chewing her cud and looking on.
</p>

<p>
And this was home at last!  A little picture from
dear old England!
</p>

<p>
Creggan stopped longer upon the locker than there
was any need for, because the tears had sprung to his
eyes, and he cared not that his chaffing messmates
should witness such weakness.
</p>

<p>
Well, soon after this they got past the breakwater
and well into the beautiful Sound.
</p>

<p>
Boats in swarms begin to surround her, but not a
soul, woman or man, can get on board till the medical
officer comes and they get pratique, a clean bill of
health.
</p>

<p>
But the men are allowed to talk from the gun-ports
to their friends and relatives beneath.  All are anxious
all are either sad or joyful.
</p>

<p>
How the wife beams when she sees her Jack's brown
face peeping smilingly down.
</p>

<p>
But oh! the grief and sorrow of some poor women
when they ask some other sailor about their Tom or
Bill.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"Where is my Tom?"
</p>

<p>
It is hard, hard to answer such questions, but it
must be done.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, missus," says Jack at the port, "we've been
a-fightin' hard wi' bloomin' niggers, and poor Tom got
scuppered!"
</p>

<p>
Some women faint.  Some turn pale, dazed, and sink
down stunned in the stern-sheets.
</p>

<p>
But see, yonder comes the medical officer, and in a
very short time the ship is free.
</p>

<p>
Then up swarm friends and relations, and meetings
and greetings are very joyful indeed.  There is a
rattling fire of questions and answers all over the
ship, and many a jolly laugh rings shoreward over
the sea.
</p>

<p>
Creggan is on the quarter-deck.  He expects no one,
but suddenly he is hailed.
</p>

<p>
"Creggan, old man!  How you have grown!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, is it you, Willie Nugent?  And you've grown
too, a little paler though."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I wish I was as brown as you, Creggan, but
I'm being dragged up for a political career, you know.
And I do hate it.  I wish I'd been a sailor."
</p>

<p>
"And how is your father?"
</p>

<p>
"Jolly."
</p>

<p>
"And Matty?"
</p>

<p>
"Your wee sweetheart is beautiful, and we are all
well.  My father has a better and larger bungalow
now in Skye, and we often go out to see the hermit.
He looks no older.  Fact, I think he is getting young
again."
</p>

<p>
"Oscar?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he did miss you at first.  But Tomnahurich
has another dog now, because he thinks on your next
cruise you are bound to get Oscar with you.  So
Kooran, and he is a beauty, will then be his
companion."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you're making me so happy, Willie; but just
one more question.  Ever see Archie?"
</p>

<p>
Willie laughed right merrily and mischievously.
</p>

<p>
"Why, he is here, Creggan; I was keeping this bit
of news to astound you."
</p>

<p>
"Archie here!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I'll call him up now."
</p>

<p>
Next minute, with kindly hand extended, there
walked, smiling but with eyes glistening with tears of
joy, a fashionably-dressed young gentleman with a
budding moustache.
</p>

<p>
"Man, is it your very, very self?"
</p>

<p>
"It is no other, dear old friend."
</p>

<p>
"I'd hardly have known you, Creggan."
</p>

<p>
"Nor I you.  But explain, my boy.  Why all this
extensive rig-out&mdash;the top hat, the morning coat, the
trousers instead of the kilt?  Why all this thusness?
Anybody left you a fortune, Archie?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!  I've lots of money, though," laughed
Archie.  "I've taken a small farm for mother and
Kory, and they live in a red stone house, and have
horses, cows, and sheep."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you in a minute.  You'll mind our games
of draughts with the bits of carrot and parsnip for
men?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I do."
</p>

<p>
"Well, a draught-player in Edinburgh challenged
all Scotland for £20 to play with him.  After you
left I often played wi' Tomnahurich.  He plays well,
but though I took off men of my own, I very soon
whipped off all his.
</p>

<p>
"'You'll go down to Edinburgh,' he said, 'and beat
this boasting fellow.  I'll lend you the money.'
</p>

<p>
"'But,' says I, 'suppose I lose it?'
</p>

<p>
"'Never mind,' says he.  'Off you go.'
</p>

<p>
"And off I went, Creggan, just the kilted ghillie I
was when you left us.  Well, there must have been a
hundred great ladies and gentlemen to watch our ten
games.  They gave me a little cheer, but my opponent
looked at me in proud disdain.  I didn't like it, and
determined to win.  You know the old Cameronian
motto&mdash;<i>Whate'er a man dares he can do</i>,&mdash;and by
St. Kilda, Creggan, I soon lowered that toff's play.
I won the first four games, getting his last crowned
head in a fix every time.
</p>

<p>
"The room was stuffy and hot, and my head swam
a bit, so he licked me in the fifth.  Ah! playing in a
hot room isn't like playing on the breezy cliffs, or
among the wild thyme.
</p>

<p>
"Well, they opened a window, and our table was
drawn near to it&mdash;and, Creggan boy, that toff never
won another game.
</p>

<p>
"What cheering! what rejoicing!  Why, a duchess
took me in her arms and kissed me, and a tall swell
caught me by the hand.
</p>

<p>
"'You dear little Highlander!  You've got to come
to my house to-morrow.  I backed you for two thou.,
and I'll make you share it.'
</p>

<p>
"And now, Creggan, I'm champion player of Britain;
but I've been challenged out to the States, and I hope
I'll win there too."
</p>

<p>
Next day the three friends dined together at the
chief hotel.  Oh, such a happy night!  Then, as soon
as leave was obtained&mdash;the ship being paid off,&mdash;they
all started for Glasgow by boat, and thence, again by
boat, to the beautiful Island of Wings.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
WELCOME BACK TO SKYE.
</h3>

<p>
Creggan Ogg M'Vayne might well sing of
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A life on the ocean wave,<br />
  A home on the rolling deep".<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Well, any man who is worth the noble name of sailor
loves his ship, and looks upon her as "home" in the
real sense of the word.  Nor does he long for any
other while the commission lasts.  But oh! when the
order to return comes on board, then there is
something within him that, though it may have been
slumbering for years, awakes at once, and he is eager,
even to excitement, to see once more the woods and
flowery fields of England, or the wild straths and
glens of green Caledonia.
</p>

<p>
When the boat discharged Willie and Creggan at
Portree, the latter felt that he was indeed at home.
</p>

<p>
"No, Willie, we won't walk.  I'm too impatient far
for that."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do whatever you do, old man."
</p>

<p>
So they hired a fast horse and dogcart; the driver
a man who could hold the ribbons well, the nag as
sure-footed as a mule.
</p>

<p>
The day was bright and bracing, so that Creggan's
spirits rose with every milestone passed.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Perhaps in no country in all the wide world is the
early autumn more lovely than in our own dear
Scottish Highlands.  The fierce heat of summer that
erst was reflected from the lofty crags and mountain
brows to the straths below, is mitigated now.  The
grass is still green in the bonnie bosky dells, through
which streamlets meander over their pebbly beds and
go singing to the sea.  Though the winds are whispering
now among the birchen foliage, and the tall
needled pine-trees, with a harsher voice than that of
sweet spring-time, the tall ferns in many a quiet and
sylvan nook wave wild and bonnie, their fronds of
green and brown making a charming background to
the crimson nodding bells of the foxglove.  And the
hills above are purple and crimson with heather and
heath, with many a rugged crag or gray rock peeping
through, which only serve to enhance their beauty.
</p>

<p>
But here in the north of Skye are no trees, though
the heather is a sight to see, and so you hardly miss
the dark waving pines.
</p>

<p>
"I'm just so happy," said Creggan, "that I believe
I could sing."
</p>

<p>
"My dear boy," said Willie, "I already know
enough about politics to be able to assure you that
no act of parliament has yet been passed against
singing.  Heave round, as you sailors say, and give
us a ditty."
</p>

<p>
"Give us a bass then, Willie."
</p>

<p>
"That I will, and the horse himself will beat time
to your melody."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll sing you a song our bo's'n used to troll
at the fo'castle head in starlight evenings, when our
ship was far at sea.  But I have not his voice.  It
is called&mdash;

  THE SAILOR'S RETURN.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Bleak was the morn when William left his Nancy,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleecy snow frown'd on the whitened shore,<br />
  Cold as the fears that chilled her dreary fancy,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While she her sailor from her bosom tore.<br />
  To his fill'd heart a little Nancy pressing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a young tar the ample trousers eyed,<br />
  In need of firmness, in this state distressing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will checked the rising sigh, and fondly cried:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Ne'er fear the perils of the fickle ocean,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow's all a notion,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grief all in vain;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet love, take heart,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we but part<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In joy to meet again.'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Loud blew the wind, when, leaning on that willow<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the dear name of William printed stood,<br />
  Poor Nancy saw, tossed by a faithless billow,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ship dash'd 'gainst a rock that topped the flood.<br />
  Her tender heart, with frantic sorrow thrilling,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild as the storm that howl'd along the shore,<br />
  No longer could resist a stroke so killing:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''Tis he,' she cried, 'nor shall I see him more!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did he ever trust the fickle ocean?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow's my portion,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misery and pain!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break, my poor heart,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now we part,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never to meet again.'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Mild was the eye, all nature was smiling,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four tedious years had Nancy passed in grief,<br />
  When, with her children, the sad hours beguiling,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw her William fly to her relief!<br />
  Sunk in his arms with bliss he quickly found her,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon return'd to life, to love, and joy;<br />
  While her grown young ones anxiously surround her,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now Will clasps his girl, and now his boy.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Did I not say, though 'tis a fickle ocean,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow's all a notion,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grief all in vain?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My joy how sweet!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now we meet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never to part again.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As the horse went merrily trotting along the road,
and the voices of those happy boys raised in song
was echoed from rock and brae, little kilted lads and
kirtled lassies ran out from cottage doors&mdash;for joy is
infectious&mdash;to shout and wave their bonnets as long
as they could see the trap.
</p>

<p>
And now, here is Uig once more.  The landlady
just as buxom and jolly as before, though at first she
did not know Creggan.
</p>

<p>
Here a good luncheon was made, and the horse
fed.  Then on again for many a mile, till the gray
ruins of the warlike old castle of Duntulm hove
in sight, the swift rolling Minch, and, far beyond,
the blue hills of Harris.  And yonder, too, was the
hermit's isle of Kilmara.
</p>

<p>
Some distance from the sea was Nugent's bungalow,
but all were at the door to meet Willie and Creggan,
the sailor-boy.
</p>

<p>
Matty could talk better English now, though still
a child, and just as innocent as ever.  While Creggan
rested on a chair under the pretty verandah, trying to
answer about a hundred questions at the same time,
wee Matty climbed his knee, and with one soft arm
around his neck, claimed her sailor all to herself.
</p>

<p>
Then there was the visit to the manse.  More
welcomes there from Rory, Maggie, and Mr. M'Ian.
</p>

<p>
Oh, it is really worth going to sea for a few years,
if only to receive a welcome home like this!
</p>

<p>
The sea to-day was blue and smooth, so Willie had
his skiff taken down from the manse, and with Matty
in the stern-sheets&mdash;-just in the dear old way&mdash;he
paddled out to visit his Daddy.
</p>

<p>
That was indeed a delightful meeting, but I cannot
describe it.  The new dog came furious, barking at
Creggan, but poor Oscar knew him at a glance, and
simply went wild with joy.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Let no one ever tell me that a dog forgets a kind
master.  When I myself first went to sea&mdash;in the
Royal Navy&mdash;I left my beautiful collie with my
mother.  Not only did he know me when I returned
after several years, but on the day my arrival was
announced mother said to him: "Tyro, doggie, your
master is coming to-day".  He never left the window
after that.  Never ceased to watch till, afar off, he
could see me.  Then his impatience was unbounded
till the door was opened, and he came rushing down
the road to meet me.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Creggan spent the night with Daddy, who had not
altered a bit, but he rowed Matty home first.
</p>

<p>
That evening a strange but true tale of the sea was
related to Creggan, and the mystery that surrounded
his childhood was cleared up once and for ever.
</p>

<p>
It was thought best by the minister, and by Nugent
also, that the hermit should break the news to the lad.
</p>

<p>
Know then, that not more than a month ago, a lady
in black, still beautiful, though she must have been
verging on forty, was travelling in a dog-cart through
Skye, with her own maid and coachman.
</p>

<p>
Calling at the manse, M'Ian happened among other
things to tell her of the strange story of the finding
of Creggan in the skiff on the beach of Kilmara isle.
</p>

<p>
She seemed strangely agitated.
</p>

<p>
"Is the skiff still to the fore, and might I see it?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, my dear lady."
</p>

<p>
She had hardly looked at it before she almost fainted,
and would have fallen had not M'Ian's strong arms
supported her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir, that was our boat!  Is the boy still
alive?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and at sea.  We expect him back in a month.
He was brought up by the hermit of Kilmara out
yonder."
</p>

<p>
"Do row me over there, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"With pleasure, madam."
</p>

<p>
And the minister's own boat was launched and soon
reached the island.
</p>

<p>
The hermit was mystified at first, but soon
recovering, told her all the reader already knows.
</p>

<p>
Then she told her sad story.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Sea-Swallow</i>&mdash;her husband's ship&mdash;was lying
at Harris in a little bay.  He, her husband, had been,
alas! drinking hard some weeks before this, but
seemed quite recovered, and one day she received an
invitation from the minister of the parish to go on
a picnic excursion with his children to see the
beauties of the island.  She would be back before ten.  It
was autumn, and the nights were long, with bright
starlight and a little frost.  Her husband would not go
on shore, but appeared delighted to be left in charge
of the child.  The mother had not been gone over two
hours, and night had fallen, when he told the first
to call away the skiff, a light kind of dinghy.
He told him he was going on shore to the manse, and
would take the child with him.  He was in no way
excited, but quiet and calm, and singing low to the
child as he went down the gangway ladder.
</p>

<p>
The mate watched him rowing himself towards the
shore, then went below.
</p>

<p>
The captain was never seen again.
</p>

<p>
His name was Mearns, and the <i>Sea-Swallow</i> was as
much a yacht as a trader, though she did bring cargoes
of fruit from Italy.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mearns was prostrated with grief, and for
many a long week never left her bed.  The most
Christian conclusion she could come to was that the
boat had been swamped and sunk, and both the
husband and child drowned.
</p>

<p>
But the <i>Sea-Swallow</i> was sold, and ever since poor
Mrs. Mearns had lived alone with her grief, in her
beautiful home down near to Torquay.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"And this lady is&mdash;my&mdash;mother, Daddy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my lad; and you will see her to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
And next day he was early on shore with Oscar,
and went straight to the manse.
</p>

<p>
The lady in black came slowly up the garden path
about mid-day.
</p>

<p>
Something seemed to whisper to Creggan, telling
him that this was indeed his mother.  He ran to
meet her.
</p>

<p>
She held him at arm's-length for a few seconds,
while she turned white and red by turns.
</p>

<p>
"It is indeed my long-lost son!" she cried.  "Oh,
heaven be praised for the dawn of this day!"
</p>

<p>
Then woman-like she relieved her feelings by weeping.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mearns took up her abode at the manse for
two months, all the time, in fact, that Creggan spent
in Skye.  But she seemed quite a changed woman,
and looked ten years younger at least.
</p>

<p>
She no longer wore mourning, but light-coloured,
beautiful dresses.  She played and sang too, in a
manner that quite fascinated the minister, and she
took part in all the rambles about this wild romantic
island.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Well, partings came again, and with them tears and
blessings.  Oh, that sad word "Farewell"!
</p>

<p>
In a week after this Creggan and his mother were
at Torquay.  But a delightful old-fashioned wooden
paddle frigate was commissioned at Plymouth.  She
was going on Special Service, to carry despatches here,
there, and everywhere.  Creggan went on purpose to
see her, and though the carpenters, or wood-peckers
as we used to call them, were still on board, the
lad&mdash;who, by the way, had been promoted to sub-lieutenant,
wore a stripe and carried a sword&mdash;liked her so much,
that he made an application to be appointed to her.
</p>

<p>
His appointment came in a few days.
</p>

<p>
Then Creggan once more took the bold step of
calling on the captain, and with him went Oscar.
</p>

<p>
Captain Leeward opened the door, and when the
young sub-lieutenant introduced himself&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come in, my good fellow.  No, no, don't shut
the door in the dear doggie's face."
</p>

<p>
So in went Creggan and in went Oscar.
</p>

<p>
"I say," said Captain Leeward, a most pleasant-faced
man, "I must ask you to bring this beautiful animal
with you.  I have a lovely black Newfoundland, and
they will be excellent companions."
</p>

<p>
Had anyone handed Creggan a cheque for £10,000,
he could not have been more delighted than he was
at this moment.
</p>

<p>
Then in stalked the very dog the captain had
mentioned.  Creggan had never seen so noble a fellow
before.
</p>

<p>
He appeared a little surprised at seeing another dog
in the room, but as soon as Oscar went up and licked
his ear&mdash;a dog's kiss&mdash;he took to him at once, and
before Creggan left they both lay asleep together
before the fire.
</p>

<p>
"I've heard all about you from Captain Flint
himself&mdash;rather a tartar sometimes, but possessed of a
right good heart.  You must stay to supper, and we'll
swap yarns, you know.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," he added, "do you know that your
bold messmate, Dr. Grant, has been appointed to this
ship?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know, but I feel so pleased!"
</p>

<p>
A very delightful evening Creggan spent, till nine
o'clock, then he begged leave to go.
</p>

<p>
The last thing that Captain Leeward said as he
shook Creggan's hand was this:
</p>

<p>
"You saved your captain's life, lad.  Your courage
in presence of the enemy was conspicuous, and although
the Admiralty is slow&mdash;it won't forget you!
</p>

<p>
"Good-night.  Join your ship in a week's time."
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, sir.  You have made me very happy."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
LIFE ON THE GOOD SHIP <i>OSPREY</i>.
</h3>

<p>
It was a stormy day in the end of October when the
good frigate <i>Osprey</i> got up steam and put out to
sea.
</p>

<p>
Signals had been exchanged for an hour before this
between the admiral's office and the ship.  The
admiral thought it most imprudent to sail on such a day.
</p>

<p>
Captain Leeward was persistent, however, and at
last, like any other wilful man, he had his way.
</p>

<p>
The wind was from the east-south-east, cold and
bitter and high.  The air, too, was filled with sleet or
snow.
</p>

<p>
When they passed the breakwater it caught her
bows smartly, and slued her for a few moments out of
her course.  But the helmsman quickly put her up,
and the strong paddles fought the water fiercely, and
successfully too.
</p>

<p>
Balked in its design of driving the <i>Osprey</i> against
the breakwater, the wind did all sorts of ill-natured
things.  It cut the smoke of the funnel clean off, and
drove its dark wreaths to leeward; it rattled the braces,
it shook the rigging; it slammed the companion
doorways, swayed the hanging boats about, and dashed the
spray inboard with sometimes a green sea, till
everybody who had to be on deck and hadn't an oilskin on
was drenched to the skin.  A nasty, disagreeable old
wind!
</p>

<p>
The <i>Osprey</i> didn't seem to mind it a bit.  She had a
broad beam of her own, a strong bowsprit and jibboom,
and she lifted her bows slowly, and with a sturdy
disdain that showed she cared for neither wind nor
sea.
</p>

<p>
Nor did the men either&mdash;every one of whom had
been picked and chosen by Captain Leeward himself,
every one of whom was as hardy as the vikings of old.
</p>

<p>
Before the ship was two miles from the Sound,
and while standing amidships talking to Grant,&mdash;the
<i>Osprey's</i> head being now turned to west-and-south, so
that spray no longer flew inboard,&mdash;Creggan said:
</p>

<p>
"Listen, doctor; what a grand singer!"
</p>

<p>
For up from the forehatch rose high above the roar
of the wind a manly voice, singing one of Dibdin's
most favourite songs:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Blow high, blow low, let tempests tear<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mainmast by the board,<br />
  My heart with thoughts of thee, my dear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love well stor'd,<br />
  Shall brave all danger, scorn all fear;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roaring winds, the raging sea;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hopes on shore<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be once more<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe moor'd with thee."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Yes, he sings well.  And do you know, that with
the kindliest heart that ever was in sailor's breast,
Captain Leeward has his peculiarities."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I've known him before, and sailed with him,
always in a wooden ship.  He hates an iron-clad, and
he must see canvas bellying out aloft if there be a bit
of wind at all.  He is really an independent man, and
wouldn't take a ship at all unless he had all his own
way.  So every man-jack is a jolly tar of the good old
school, and his officers too, are, I have always found,
genuine fellows.  He must have somebody to dine
with him every night, and it is just as often a middie
as a ward-room officer.  As for myself, I have always
a knife and fork laid for me, and if I don't dine with
Leeward I look in after dessert, and many a yarn he
spins me."
</p>

<p>
"So different from Flint."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; but we must never say a word against the
absent."
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Hark!" cried Grant; "didn't I tell you?"
</p>

<p>
The ship's head was kept away a point or two.
</p>

<p>
Next minute the bo's'n's shrill pipe was heard.
"<i>Eep&mdash;eep&mdash;peep&mdash;peep&mdash;ee&mdash;ee&mdash;ee!</i>  All hands
make sail!"
</p>

<p>
Up rattle the watches below, and aloft they went
right cheerily.
</p>

<p>
Creggan had never seen a ship's sails cast loose so
speedily, nor so quickly braced up.
</p>

<p>
"They are indeed good sailors, Dr. Grant."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I told you.  But look here, old fellow, just
call me 'Grant', and 'douse' the 'Dr.'."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Grant," said Creggan, laughing.
</p>

<p>
The fires were now let down and the paddles thrown
out of gear, and presently that old <i>Osprey</i> was doing
ten knots an hour on a beam wind.
</p>

<p>
I suppose that Captain Leeward had some inkling
of where he was going to, else he would not have held
this course.
</p>

<p>
But the sealed orders were opened next morning,
and he found that the <i>Osprey</i> was on particular
service, her first destination being Venezuela.
</p>

<p>
He told his officers this, and that they might then
look in at Rio and open further orders there&mdash;probably.
</p>

<p>
If, reader mine, you knew the Service as well as I
do, you would remark that it was very good of the
gallant Captain Leeward to be thus explicit with his
officers.  Many men that I know, or have known,
would have shrouded themselves in their cold dignity,
and to any inquiry made by an officer as to their
destination, would simply have replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Venezuela."
</p>

<p>
If asked, "And where next, sir?" such men would
reply, "I really can't tell you at present".
</p>

<p>
Well, lads who mean to join the glorious British
Navy, and serve either as young officers or boys
under&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'The flag that braved a thousand years<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle and the breeze',<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
must not expect their lives to be all sunshine, any
more than they need expect the sea around to be
always blue, rippled by balmy winds, and domed over
with an azure sky, flecked with fleecy cloudlets, and
at night studded with silver-shining stars.
</p>

<p>
In some ships they will find that fighting the waves
is not fun by any means, because many of the best of
our navy ships are sent to sea defective.  Machinery&mdash;and
it is marvellously intricate nowadays&mdash;may
break down at an untimely moment, even in the
midst of a terrible storm, and having no serviceable
sail, even the largest iron-clad will then be at the
mercy of the waves.  Oh, how she rolls and yaws
and plunges and careens at such a time!
</p>

<p>
The best sailors on board cannot keep their feet,
their heads swim with the awful motion.  Things
break loose and play pitch-and-toss about the deck,
the ward-room furniture may be all one chaotic heap,
and all the while the seas are making a plaything of
her, dashing over her, high as the conning tower, and
rushing in cataracts fore to aft, or even vice versa.
At such a time it seems as if the ocean wished to
show those poor wave-beleaguered sailors how small
the strongest works of man are, compared to those of
God.
</p>

<p>
But independently of storms without or the breaking
down of machinery, the ship may not be a happy
one as far as officers and men are concerned.  The
crew, all told, may be a badly assorted one, and I have
been in ships, only for a short spell, thank goodness,
that were known on the station as "floating hells".
</p>

<p>
Much depends upon one's captain.  If he is a kind-hearted,
genuine fellow he can do everything to keep
things smooth fore and aft.  The ward-room officers
take their cue from him, the gun-room follows the
example which the ward-room sets them on deck or
below, the midshipmen influence the warrant officers,
and these in their turn the able and ordinary seamen
and the first and second class boys themselves.
</p>

<p>
But I must heave ahead with my story, instead of
hauling my fore-yard aback or lying-to, in order to
ruminate and preach.  Oh, I know my own faults,
my lads; I have so much to say about sea and a life
on the ocean wave, that, with a pen in my hand, I
want to say it or write it all at once.
</p>

<p>
Well, Creggan hadn't been a day at sea before he
found out that the <i>Osprey</i> was going to be a real happy
ship.
</p>

<p>
They soon lost sight of land in the haze of the storm,
though all day long the beautiful gulls kept sailing
around the ship, tack and half-tack in the air.  For
these sea-gulls look upon ships as their own, because
from them they receive their main supply of food; so
they always follow them afar, trying, as it were, by
their plaintive calls, to get them to return.
</p>

<p>
It was dark enough at eight o'clock to-night, and
the gulls had all returned shorewards.  The gale still
raged, but the <i>Osprey</i> was under easy sail, and the
motion was by no means disagreeable to a sailor.
</p>

<p>
Creggan had been keeping the second dog-watch,
but now went below.  There was first the fighting
deck to pass through, where the great port-holes were,
and the black, shining guns, each with its snow-white
lanyard prettily coiled and lying on the breach.  A
fine open breezy deck, the shot and shell neatly
arranged in racks around the hatchways, and the
sick-bay far away forward yonder.  Abaft here was the
captain's quarters or saloon, with a red-coated, armed
sentry walking near it, slowly fore and aft.
</p>

<p>
Then Creggan dived below.  Aft again on this deck
and right under the captain's quarters, only coming
more forward, was the well-lighted ward-room, from
which issued the sound of merry voices and laughing.
Turning forward and on the port side there was first
a cabin or two, and then the gun-room.
</p>

<p>
Below this was the orlop deck, where many hammocks
were hung, and which was lined with two rows
of dingy, dark, though white-washed cabins, lighted
by day only by the round scuttle-hole, and at night by
a candle hung in jimbles.  These cabins were told off
to warrant officers, bo's'n, carpenter, &amp;c., &amp;c., and to
senior officers of the gun-room.  But really most of
these preferred a hammock just outside, for the sake
of fresher air.
</p>

<p>
To-night, Creggan, to whom one of these cabins, and
a good one too, was allotted, had occasion to go below.
He heard a sad moaning proceeding from a hammock,
and a white, white melancholy face hanging half over
the side.
</p>

<p>
"I say!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my lad."
</p>

<p>
"Are you the surgeon?  I'm very dickey.  I'm a
a clerk, and I wish I had never, never left the land."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm sub, and the second senior member of
your mess.  Don't give way.  I'll go and get the surgeon."
</p>

<p>
And so he did.
</p>

<p>
Kind-hearted Grant first gave him a doze of something,
which I know well but must not mention, then
a tumblerful of good champagne, and in five minutes'
time poor little Mr. Todd was wrapt in dreamless
slumber.
</p>

<p>
There were two more of Neptune's young children
who wanted seeing to.  Having done so, Grant went
aloft again.
</p>

<p>
Then Creggan went to his quarters.
</p>

<p>
"Come along, sir," cried one of three bold middies
who sat around the gun-room table when Creggan
drew back the curtain; "come along, and have a hand
at whist."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, messmates, but I must feed first."
</p>

<p>
"Steward!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay ay, sorr," said an unmistakably Irish voice.
"That's me, myself, sorr;" and a tallish, smart fellow,
with black buttons on his short jacket, and a blue
ground to his beardless face, entered the mess.
</p>

<p>
"Bring in the beef, and all kinds of fixings."
</p>

<p>
"Any dhrink, sorr?"
</p>

<p>
"No drink, thanks.  What's your name?"
</p>

<p>
"M'Carthy, sorr, sure enough."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mac, heave round."
</p>

<p>
"Be back afore ye could say knife, sorr."
</p>

<p>
Creggan made a capital supper.  Then he had just
one game to please the youngsters.
</p>

<p>
"I'm dying with sleep, boys," he said, "so I'll turn
in.  Ta-ta, see you all in the morning."
</p>

<p>
He departed, leaving them singing, and, turning in,
was soon sound and fast.  And thus he slept till called
to keep the morning watch.
</p>

<p>
It was a little cold, but Creggan had bent on his
thickest pilot jacket, and the second lieutenant soon
came stumping up, and he also had on his foul-weather
gear.
</p>

<p>
But the wind had gone down considerably, and
with it the sea.  She had lost way, too.  So Mellor
sent men aloft to loosen and shake out sails.  The
effect was magical, and with the wind well abaft the
beam the <i>Osprey</i> pulled herself together, threw off
dull sloth and went through the water like a thing of
life.  All along the top-gallant bulwarks forward,
the spray was sprinkled as the good ship spurned the
billows, but nothing came aft.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mellor, the lieutenant, a round-faced, fair-haired
young Cornishman, strode up and down the deck
talking, and smoking a short clay.  Creggan and he
were swapping yarns&mdash;humorous yarns mostly&mdash;and
exchanging experiences, and were soon as well
acquainted as if they had known each other for years.
</p>

<p>
Soon after five bells, a light was seen gradually
spreading over the eastern horizon, getting higher and
higher momentarily.  It looked at first like the
reflection of a far-off city on a dark night.
</p>

<p>
But the light grew whiter and brighter.
</p>

<p>
It was gray dawn now.  Then high up in the west
a streak of a cloud began to glow with orange and
crimson beauty.  Rolling clouds on the horizon astern
were lit up with a fringe of gold and carmine.  Then
all the east became a glory of colour that was almost
dazzling, but very beautiful.  The god of day was
rising, and this dazzlingly-painted orient formed the
curtains of his couch.
</p>

<p>
Soon now, red and fiery, his beams spread in a path
of blood across the sea, and lo! it was day.
</p>

<p>
Both Creggan and Mellor spent that watch very
pleasantly, and before going below the latter held out
his hand, and Creggan gladly grasped it.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," said Mellor.  "We're going to be friends,
you know."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
MESS-ROOM FUN.
</h3>

<p>
The gun-room mess of H.M.S. <i>Osprey</i> was by no
means an overcrowded one&mdash;three middies, an
assistant-paymaster, a clerk, another sub-lieutenant,
Mr. Wickens,[<a id="chap17fn1text"></a><a href="#chap17fn1">1</a>] and Creggan himself.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap17fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap17fn1text">1</a>] My prototype for this young officer
was Sydney Dickens, the son of the
great novelist, with whom I was shipmate,
the dearest little fellow I ever
knew.&mdash;G.S.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
One middie did not really belong to the mess.  He
was a supernumerary, going out to join the flag-ship
on the South American coast.
</p>

<p>
Midshipman Robertson was a funny little fellow.
Not bad-looking, but choke-full of merriment and
ideas for practical jokes, and when he talked to his
messmates down below, he always screwed his face into
puckers and dimples with the laughter he tried in
vain to conceal.  He was an Edinburgh boy, while
young O'Callaghan, the supernumerary, came from
Killarney, and was just as Irish as the steward.
</p>

<p>
Many a droll logomachy used to take place at dinner-time
between little Scottie and this Killarney lad.  All
in fun, of course.
</p>

<p>
Young Bobbie, as he was called, delighted to tease
Paddy O'Callaghan.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't give Paddy another morsel!" cried
Bobbie one day at dinner, as the Irish boy passed his
plate to sub-lieutenant Sidney Wickens for another
slice of beef.
</p>

<p>
"And why not, you Dougal Crayture?"[<a id="chap17fn2text"></a><a href="#chap17fn2">2</a>] cried
O'Callaghan.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap17fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap17fn2text">2</a>] The red-haired Highlander in Scott's tale of "Rob Roy".
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"For your own sweet sake, Paddy.  I really must
look after you.  Coming from a land of potatoes and
buttermilk and&mdash;want and woe, over-indulgence in
the roast beef of Old England might have serious
consequences.  Indeed, indeed it might."
</p>

<p>
"Want yourself!  I hurl the insinuation back.
Sure, it wasn't for want that I came here."
</p>

<p>
"No, Paddy, no,&mdash;because you had too much of that
at home, you know."
</p>

<p>
And the laugh was all against poor Paddy this
time.
</p>

<p>
When the plum-pudding came on that day, again
Bobbie held up a warning finger.
</p>

<p>
"Mind what I told you, Paddy," he said solemnly,
"or I'll have to write to your mother, and she'll take
you back home to look after the pigs."
</p>

<p>
"Sure it's yourself that should go home," retorted
O'Callaghan.  "If all reports be true, you'd make
more money in bonnie Scotland than here."
</p>

<p>
"But how, Paddy darlint?"
</p>

<p>
"How?  Is it yourself that asks?  Didn't the Duke
of Argyle&mdash;God bless him&mdash;put up rubbing-stones in
every field?  Well, you'd make a dacint living if you
just stood beside one and sold butter and brimstone.
That's for you this time!"
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
After the first storm the weather became glorious.
A splendid breeze, that filled every sail, blew over the
sparkling sea&mdash;a breeze that made every sailor's heart
beat with joy, a breeze that made every man-Jack
lithe and active, ay, and happy, bringing merry
laughter to the lips and song from the very heart.
</p>

<p>
Captain Leeward was very proud of his ship.
</p>

<p>
"She isn't much of a fighter perhaps, you know,"
he said, "and I dare say a shell or two from a big
gun would speedily rip her up, but she is comfortable
and dry and nice, and for all the world like
a yacht, and so I love her."
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't be a sailor if you didn't, sir," said
Grant, whom he was addressing.  "But I never saw
a ship before so prettily finished, both on the upper
and fighting decks.  The Lords Commissioners have
been good to you."
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha!" laughed the captain.  "It is little indeed
you can get out of them.  I did the decorations&mdash;extra
paint and gilding, and all that&mdash;out of my own
pocket, doctor."
</p>

<p>
"You have zeal for the Service, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it.  The Admiralty hold out no
encouragement for men to be zealous.  But I have
zeal for my own comfort, and you won't catch me in
a box-heater (ironclad), or a torpedo-boat either, if
I can help it."
</p>

<p>
In the captain's private cabin was a large sealed
box of private despatches.  This, on being opened,
was found to contain letters for war-ships both at the
Azores and Bermuda.  So the vessel's course was
changed to a more southerly direction, and on she
sped, with stun'sails set.
</p>

<p>
Well might Leeward be proud of the appearance
of his ship's decks.  Brass-work shone like burnished
gold; hard wood glittered like boatman beetles.  Never
a rope's-end was left uncoiled; the decks themselves,
scrubbed early every morning, were as white as
piano-keys, and so were even the capstan bars; while the
sailors themselves, with their brown, hardy faces, were
dressed in white trousers and jackets of blue.
</p>

<p>
It was not a temperance ship, yet, although the man
who did the day's cooking for each mess of sixteen
men had a plentiful allowance of rum, no one was
ever reported by the master-at-arms as being even
a trifle the worse of drink.  On fine evenings Captain
Leeward encouraged games.  Ship's quoits was a
favourite pastime, so was the running high-leap;
hop-step-and-jump; and leap-frog, once begun, would be
kept up all round the deck till the men were ready to
drop.  Of course, with the swaying of the ship, the
men had many a tumble, but this only added to the
general mirth and merriment.
</p>

<p>
Don't imagine, dear reader, that the gun-room
officers took no part in these sports.  They couldn't
keep out of them, and Paddy and little Scottie might
have been seen vaulting over each other, time about,
as if their very lives depended on it.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Grant must have his little joke at times, and
one day he announced to the officers of the gun-room
mess that he was in a mood to offer a first, second,
and third prize for the winners at standing high-leap.
</p>

<p>
Next forenoon the sports came off.  Well, the ship
that day was rolling rather, so that it was a difficult
thing to stand at all.
</p>

<p>
However, everyone had the same chance, so the
game came off.  Creggan made a fairly good third,
but Paddy and Bobbie tied for first.
</p>

<p>
"It's you and me, old stupidnumerary," cried Scottie.
"You first.  <i>Ignis via</i>&mdash;fire away!"
</p>

<p>
The rod was lowered several pegs, and the
"stupid-numerary" cleared it easily.
</p>

<p>
So did Bobbie.
</p>

<p>
Up another peg, again the same, and so on till
some inches over four feet.
</p>

<p>
Now, as Paddy was about to leap, the ship gave
a bit of a bob, and the poor "stupidnumerary"
kicked off the rod and fell on the softest part of his
body.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" cried Bobbie.  "Scotland's going to clear it!"
</p>

<p>
He waited a few seconds till the <i>Osprey</i> was on an
even keel, then sprang over it like a bird.
</p>

<p>
He had won, and the cheering was deafening, even
Hurricane Bob the Newfoundland and Oscar joined in
and made the welkin ring, while Bobbie pretended to
clap his wings and crow.
</p>

<p>
Then all hands, including the victorious trio, drew
aft to be present at the distribution of the prizes.
</p>

<p>
"Midshipman Robertson&mdash;First Prize."
</p>

<p>
Bobby sprang forward with alacrity and received&mdash;a
mustard leaf.
</p>

<p>
"What is this for?" he said, with a droll look.
</p>

<p>
"Damp it," said the doctor, "and put it on your face
to make you blush.  I'm sure nothing else can."
</p>

<p>
"Midshipman O'Callaghan&mdash;Second Prize."
</p>

<p>
Up came the supernumerary and received&mdash;an ounce
of Epsom salts.
</p>

<p>
"But, doctor, dear," cried Paddy, "what am I to do
with them, at all, at all?"
</p>

<p>
"Swallow them, lad, to draw the blood from your head.
</p>

<p>
"Third Prize&mdash;a box of rhubarb pills."
</p>

<p>
Creggan laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Pills," said Dr. Grant, "and medicine of nearly
every sort, are the best things in the world for the
inside&mdash;of a rat's hole."
</p>

<p>
Creggan thanked him, and retired.
</p>

<p>
That evening the captain gave a dinner-party,
invited to which were Creggan, Grant, and the second
lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
It was a pretty little dinner.  The captain's cook was
really a <i>chef</i>, and the steward a smart young fellow
from Austria, whom he had picked up at a London
hotel, and who now acted also in the capacity of valet
and took the greatest interest in all his master said
and did.  They say that no man is ever a hero to
his valet, but it is the exception that proves the
rule.
</p>

<p>
Antonio Brisha was that exception.
</p>

<p>
Both Hurricane Bob and Oscar were among the
invited guests to the dinner-party.
</p>

<p>
Now there was only one drawback to Hurricane Bob's
presence either outside or inside the captain's quarters.
He was so black that the steward, who, when the ship
was rolling a bit had to keep his eye on the dish he
was carrying so as to balance it, could not see him in
the gloaming, and more than once he had tumbled
right over the honest dog, while the dish was smashed
and the joint of meat continued the journey on its own
account.
</p>

<p>
On such occasions Antonio used to say "Bother!"
only he said it more so.
</p>

<p>
But on this particular evening everything passed
off delightfully.  When told they must behave, "Oh,
certainly, sir", the dogs seemed to reply, and
Hurricane Bob at once jumped up and on to the captain's
beautiful sofa&mdash;the room was furnished like a lady's
boudoir.
</p>

<p>
But Oscar, with his bonnie face and long sable coat,
was not going to lie on the deck any more than his
companion.  So he not only leapt upon the sofa, but
from thence on to the top of the piano, there lying
down on the loose sheets of music with his chin upon
his fore-paws, so that he commanded a bird's-eye
view of the table and everything thereon&mdash;the
snow-white cloth, the bright silver, the sparkling cruets
and crystal, the flowers, and the fairy-lights.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir," cried Creggan half-rising, "shall I turn
him out?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it.  Let poor Oscar lie there, he has
more good qualities than many a Christian."
</p>

<p>
Oscar moved not.  But he shook his bushy tail by
way of thanks.
</p>

<p>
During this delightful little dinner-party, the
conversation was quite untrammelled by anything like
conventionality&mdash;free and easy, as a sailor's dinner
should be.  No one attempted to restrain himself from
laughing, if there was a good thing said; and, as is the
case wherever sailors meet, the conversation changed
from one tack to another, often going right about, like a
ship in a sea-way, if any new subject suggested itself.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Captain Leeward," said Grant, "I believe I
will have another small slice of that most delicious beef.
Ah, sir," he added, "I fear we won't live like this all
the cruise.  Fighting cocks aren't in it, sir."
</p>

<p>
The captain laughed as he helped his doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Ever been nearly starved, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't really say I have.  You?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes," replied the Doctor, "more than once.
But on one occasion, while slaver-hunting on the East
Coast of Africa in the little <i>P&mdash;&mdash;</i>, our mess ran into
debt.  The commander was honest to a fault, and
determined we should live on ship's provisions&mdash;salt
junk, pork, peas, &amp;c., with rancid butter and barrelled
eggs&mdash;ugh!&mdash;till we cleared off our debt.  But this
wasn't the worst, for our ship's stores had run short,
and it would be months before we could get another
supply, so we were put six upon four."
</p>

<p>
Creggan looked inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"I mean, Creggan," said Mr. Grant, "that six men&mdash;the
number in our mess&mdash;had to live on the allowance
of four, and share it as well as they could.
</p>

<p>
"We had plenty of biscuits, however, but so full of
dust and weevils were they, and so black with the
attentions the huge cockroaches had paid them, that
before we could eat them they had to be fried in bacon
fat.
</p>

<p>
"There was no growling or snarling, however, we
were all very young, and formed as jolly a little mess
as anyone could wish to be member of.
</p>

<p>
"I was caterer.  It was a red-letter day, or two even,
if, while on shore at say Mozambique, I could fall in
with a sucking-pig."
</p>

<p>
"You requisitioned it?" said the captain.
</p>

<p>
"That's it.  I used to say, Piggie, I arrest you in
the Queen's name.  Piggie spoke out, but I used to
hand it to my marine, and he stopped the squealing.
</p>

<p>
"Huge yams roasted in the engine-room ashes,
we thought a dish fit to set before a king.  One yam,
with pepper, salt, butter, and fried biscuit, would make
a midnight supper for four of us.  Then we could
sleep.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes on shore I stumbled across an Arab
who had a few ostrich's eggs for sale, and again we
were in clover."
</p>

<p>
"Are they very large, Grant?" said Creggan.
</p>

<p>
"Well, one broken and made into a kind of mash
was all that six of us could eat for breakfast, flanked,
of course, by a morsel of salt pork.  After such a
breakfast as this we would go singing on deck.  We
did manage to shoot some gulls now and then, and
when skinned they didn't taste so very fishy.
</p>

<p>
"One day we caught a young shark; he made some
trouble on deck, but gave up the ghost at last, and
submitted to be cut up and shared with all the crew.
</p>

<p>
"Flying-fish wouldn't come near us, but a bonito was
sometimes hooked, and when inshore we got bucketfuls
of rock-oysters.  So we didn't do so badly upon
the whole, except when far out in the Indian Ocean
making a long passage from one island to another.
</p>

<p>
"We took a Bishop of Central Africa[<a id="chap17fn3text"></a><a href="#chap17fn3">3</a>] and a Doctor
of Divinity down with us to the Cape&mdash;a three weeks'
voyage from Zanzibar.  It was then we suffered most, for
even the skipper's "prog" ran short, and as we couldn't
have the Church suffer, we used to give them some of
our scanty allowance, in return for which Captain
Mill never failed to send us a bottle of wine&mdash;we had
no rum.  We mulled that bottle of port at eventide,
steeped weevily biscuits in it, then drank and yarned
and sang.

"While eating our miserable dinner our chief conversation
turned upon the 'spreads' we had enjoyed at
English hotels, and the 'feeds' we meant to have when
we once more reached
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The home of the brave and the free'."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Well," said Captain Leeward, "your yarn, doctor,
reminds me, that when I was a mite of a middle, only
thirteen years of age, and that is longer ago than I
like to believe, I was serving in the old flagship
<i>Princess Royal</i>, on the China station, the ward-room
mess, which contained some sprigs of nobility,
got terribly into debt.
</p>

<p>
"This was a serious matter for the chief engineer, a
plain-going old fellow, who had a wife and healthy
family at home in England, and for the staff-commander,
or master also.  But the latter undertook to
cater for a time, so as to free the mess from debt.
He was to cater on the most economical principles.  I
may tell you, however, that between the chief engineer
and master there was almost a blood feud.  But the
former, although objecting to expenses, dearly loved a
good luncheon, and this was the meanest meal of the
day.
</p>

<p>
"The chief would come below, give one glance over
the table, then sink into his chair as sulky as a badger.
Then didn't the wags around the mess-table tease him
anyhow."
</p>

<p>
At this point of the yarn there was a smart knock
at the ward-room door, the midshipman, or rather the
midshipmite, of the watch entered, and, saluting the
captain, told him that there was a clear light far away
on the weather bow, and so low in the water was it,
that the first lieutenant thought it must be in a boat,
and that as the light was being waved about as if to
attract attention, the men must be in distress.
</p>

<p>
"Is there much wind?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir; we're not doing more than two knots an
hour."
</p>

<p>
"Well, bear up towards the mysterious light, anyhow,
and let me know again when you get alongside."
</p>

<p>
"Ay ay, sir," said Bobbie, backing astern and
shutting the door carefully after him.
</p>

<p>
"Now, sir," said Grant, "perhaps you'll finish your
yarn."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, certainly."

CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
ST. ELMO'S FIRE.
</h3>

<p>
"I was saying," he went on, "when Mr. Robertson
came in, that knowing the chief engineer's
weakness, they chaffed him unmercifully.
</p>

<p>
"'Dalison,'[<a id="chap18fn1text"></a><a href="#chap18fn1">1</a>] one would say, 'allow me to send you
some liver?'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap18fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap18fn1text">1</a>] Not the chief's real name.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"'No, thank 'ee,' gruffly from the chief, as he leant
back in his chair and frowned.
</p>

<p>
"'May I help you to some tripe, Dalison?'  This
from another tormentor.
</p>

<p>
"'No, thank 'ee.'
</p>

<p>
"'A morsel of kidney or heart, Dalison?'
</p>

<p>
"'No, thank 'ee.'
</p>

<p>
"Then he would bang his fist on the table, shouting,
'None of your hoffals (offals) for me!  Stooard, bring
in a lump o' bread and the blue cheese!'"
</p>

<p>
After the rippling laughter ceased, the captain,
cracking a walnut, continued:
</p>

<p>
"Chaff was much more common in the service in
those days than it is now, and if a brother officer had
any peculiarity, he was sure to catch it hot.
</p>

<p>
"Dr. R&mdash;&mdash; was a grumpy old surgeon that I was
shipmate with.  He was not only grumpy, but surly
and uncongenial towards his fellows.  He was generally
a little late for breakfast, and on his entering the
ward-room detested being talked to.
</p>

<p>
"Here was food for game, and as soon as he came
in, every officer all round the table had a kind word
and inquiry for him.
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, good-morning, doctor.'
</p>

<p>
"'How have you slept, doctor?'
</p>

<p>
"'How do you feel on the whole, this morning?'
</p>

<p>
"'I trust I see you well?'
</p>

<p>
"At first he merely growled and grunted, but at
last getting fully exasperated he would suddenly turn
round and roar out:
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, good-morning!  Good-morning!  Good-morning!
Hang the whole lot of you!'"
</p>

<p>
"Capital!" cried Grant.  "Give us just one more
doctor's yarn, Captain Leeward."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, this next one hinges upon an admiral
as well as a doctor.  This gallant officer was always
fancying himself ill, though there was never anything
of the slightest importance the matter with him,
and was never happy unless his fleet-surgeon, a dear
little Irishman, paid him a daily visit and ordered
medicine.
</p>

<p>
"A certain pill used to be prescribed, and was found
to be most efficacious.
</p>

<p>
"But one day the admiral, or 'Ral', as he was called
for short, gave a great dinner-party, and many mighty
magnates, gentlemen and ladies as well, came off
shore.  Among the guests was, of course, the Irish
fleet-surgeon.
</p>

<p>
"During the dinner the admiral somewhat inopportunely
called out:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, doctor, those pills you gave me last are by
far the best ever I've had.  You must let me have
the prescription when we pay off.  What are they
composed of?'
</p>

<p>
"Now, the good doctor did not half-relish the notion
of 'shop' being brought on the tapis at so fashionable
a dinner-party, so he answered with emphasis:
</p>

<p>
"'What are they made of?  Why, bread!  Bread,
sir; nothing else!'
</p>

<p>
"There was a momentary silence around the table,
and everyone looked aghast to see how the reply
would be taken.  But the admiral was a gentleman
in the truest sense of the word, and always most
considerate for the feelings of others.  He saw that
he had touched on a very unpleasant theme, so he
smiled kindly, and passed it off by saying in his quiet
way:
</p>

<p>
"'Well, well, well, such is Faith!'
</p>

<p>
"But the pills were really rhubarb after all."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
So with pleasant chat a whole hour passed away,
and then once more the midshipmite Bobbie knocked
at the door.
</p>

<p>
"It is a boat, sir.  Five poor men in it.  Two lying
apparently dead under the thwarts.  The first lieutenant
has hauled the fore-yard aback and is sending
some men over the side."
</p>

<p>
The <i>Osprey</i>, I may say here, had already visited
the lovely fairy isles called The Azores, and was now
well out into the Atlantic, steering about west-sou'-west.
</p>

<p>
The captain's room was soon emptied now, all going
on deck.  The night was very clear and starry, with
a bright scimitar of a moon slowly sinking in the
west.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Bobbie was right.  Two men were dead, and
the other three could scarcely speak, owing to sheer
exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
"We'll hear their story to-morrow.  Dr. Grant, I'll
leave them in your charge."
</p>

<p>
"I shall see to them, sir," said Grant.
</p>

<p>
Then he shouted "Sentry!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay ay, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Pass the word for the sick-bay man."
</p>

<p>
In another quarter of an hour the poor fellows,
English merchantmen, were snug and warm in hammocks.
Grant ordered some beef-tea, with a modicum
of brandy, and they soon fell sound asleep.
</p>

<p>
But so weak were they next day that the doctor
forbade their talking, and it was three whole days
before they were strong enough to tell their story.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
A TERRIBLE TALE OF THE SEA.
</p>

<p>
There was no false pride about Captain Leeward of
H.M. paddle-frigate <i>Osprey</i>.  Some commanding officers
that I have known would have had one of these
unfortunate castaways to tell his story in the sick-bay.
But instead of this the captain told the doctor to
bring him in to his quarters.
</p>

<p>
He was a brown-faced, hardy, bearded sailor, but
his cheeks were hollow now from his want of food
and terrible suffering.
</p>

<p>
One hand was tied up in a sling.
</p>

<p>
He bowed and scraped as he came in, and if ever
a sailor looked shy he did.
</p>

<p>
He gave just one glance around him, and then
looked at Leeward's pleasant smiling face.  The
glance reassured him.
</p>

<p>
"Why, jigger me," he said, hitching up his trousers
with one hand, "jigger me, sir, if ever I cast anchor in
such a pretty saloon as this afore.  Easy chairs, sofa,
piano, fiddle and all, to say nothing about flowers and
fairy-lights.  Cap'n Leeward, sir, I ain't in a dream,
am I?  Mebbe the doctor here will 'blige by sticking
a pin in me, up to the blessed head, if I am."
</p>

<p>
"Never a dream, Mr. Goodwin.  Well, if you will
bring yourself to an anchor, we'd like to hear your
story.  Have a little wine, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Purser's wine is the only sort as suits me, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Steward, the rum!"
</p>

<p>
A tumbler and wine-glass were placed before the
good sailor.  The latter he pushed aside.  Then, while
the castaway held the tumbler with all the four fingers
turned towards the captain, the steward filled it
fully four inches.  This is what is called "a bo's'n's nip".
</p>

<p>
"A little water, my lad?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, no; not for me.  This rum is too good to
be drowned."
</p>

<p>
He quaffed it, sighed, and put down the empty
tumbler.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, sir!" he said, "now that very word 'drowned'
makes me shiver.  I've been, on and off, boy and man,
at sea for well-nigh twenty years.  Just entered as a
boy, a tow-headed lad of Liverpool.  Nothing to do
till I growed a bit 'cepting to empty cook's ashes and
pail, look after the dogs and ship's cat, feed the
monkeys, and get kicked about all over the deck by
anybody who wanted to stretch his legs a bit.
</p>

<p>
"But I grew into an able seaman at last.  After'n
which I gets to be second mate o' a Newcastle collier.
Then fust mate.  Then I up and studies for my certificate.
You wouldn't think it, mebbe, of a rough chap
like me, but I passed with flying colours, and steered
homewards, wi' stunsails 'low and aloft, jolly happy
now.
</p>

<p>
"I meets some maties, and two more overhauled
me.  So what could I do but go with 'em to wet my
certificate.
</p>

<p>
"Sakes alive, cap'n! but I'd blush like a wirgin
even now, if I weren't so brown and weather-beaten
that ye wouldn't notice it.
</p>

<p>
"For, sir, I awoke next morning with a two-horse
headache, and a tongue like kippered salmon.  Clothes
all on too, boots and all.  I'd turned in all standing,
but couldn't remember who'd brought me into port.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, sir.  'Twere a lesson to me I ain't
going to forget.  Thankee, sir, I will have just another
nip.
</p>

<p>
"But I s'pect, cap'n, I'm a kind o' hinderin' you
I always do take longer time to tune my fiddle than
to play my tune.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, it ain't more'n six weeks since I sailed
from Glasgow, in what I might call the sailing
steamer-barque <i>Ossian</i>.  Our orders were to visit Azores,
Madeira, St. Helena, Ascension, on our way to the
Cape and Madagascar, and our supercargo, a business
Scot, was to deal everywhere, for cash or goods, for we
were laden up with 'notions' as the Yank calls 'em.
</p>

<p>
"Well, cap'n, our ship was as nice a craft as ever I
stepped on board of, and the crew, too, was on the
whole fairish; only too many blessed foreigners among
them to please me.  Most o' these'll work, ay, and
sing too, in fair weather and fair wind, but they ain't
no hand, sir, at reefin' topsails in a dirty night, wi'
green seas a-tumbling in, and mebbe the yard-arms
'most a-touching the water every time the ship leans
over.
</p>

<p>
"And we had dirty weather all along; sometimes
'twould be blowin' so hard we wouldn't be doin' more'n
two knots against wind and sea, full steam up.
</p>

<p>
"We dawdled about the islands a bit, and the fine
weather sort o' come at last, cause we was told to sail
all we could and save the coals.
</p>

<p>
"We weighed at last, and had made a good offing into
the Atlantic, 'cause it had occurred to Brown, the
supercargo, that he could do a bit of honest biz at Bermuda,
and the man was all in the interest of his owners.
</p>

<p>
"Some two or three hundred miles to the west here,
we got into a circular storm and suffered severely.
Our foremast was torn out of her, and two men slipped
overboard in clearing away the wreck.
</p>

<p>
"Thankee, cap'n; but mind ye, this makes my third
nip.  Howsomedever, it's as mild as cocoa-nut milk.
</p>

<p>
"When we got clear away from that baby tornado,
we was pretty nearly all wreck, gentleman.  Bulwarks
anyhow, mainyard even fallen (a rare accident), and
our very winch half-throwed up on its end.
</p>

<p>
"But worse were to come, cap'n.
</p>

<p>
"First and foremost the weather got finer, but there
was a strange kind o' a haze in the sky that I didn't
like.  That shortened the sunbeams considerable, and
brought night and darkness aboard of us before they
was due; and the moon couldn't well be 'xpected to
shine through clouds that the sun hadn't been able to
tackle.  We managed to step jury-mast and bend new
sails.  But the wind was nothin' to signify now, and
I made bold to tell the skipper that he ought to clue
and get up steam.
</p>

<p>
"'There's no hurry, Jim," he answered; 'even if we
be becalmed a bit, it's cheaper than burning tons o'
coal."
</p>

<p>
"Well, gentlemen, becalmed we was just after tea-time.
</p>

<p>
"I went on deck arter this, and such a night I'd
never seen afore.  Never a puff o' wind, sails hangin'
idle, and the waves, as much as we could see of them,
just like glycerine.  I expected to see dead fish
floating about on their sides.
</p>

<p>
"The bo's'n was walkin' with me in the ship's waist;
but none of us had very cheery yarns to spin, we just
stuck to our pipes and spoke but little.
</p>

<p>
"I could feel the bo's'n's arm tremble a little, though,
as more than once a long quavering cry came over the
surface of that hazy, oily ocean, dyin' away in a kind
o' wail, like some poor creature in faintin' agony.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I believe 'twere on'y a bird, sir; and there do
be a shark that cries thus on windless nights near to the
echoless ocean&mdash;the Sea of Weeds, or Sargasso.  And
'twere there we were at this time.  Every now and
then we could observe long dark strips of the slimy
stuff layin' along the rippleless waves' sides, dark and
fearful, and looking for all the world like dead serpents.
</p>

<p>
"I'se a kind o' partial to pottery (poetry), cap'n, and
lines from Coleridge's <i>Ancient Mariner</i> would keep
risin' up in my mind, and didn't seem out o' place either
on a night like that.  'Cause you see that, here and
there, there was phosphorescence in the sea, and a shark
had once or twice appeared on the surface, his sly eyes
flashing, his fins dropping fire, and we could see him as
he dived below getting smaller and smaller, till like a
little wriggling worm of flame.  Even little strips of
weed that floated here and there looked like water-serpents.

great banks of ugly rock-and-castle clouds in front, a

</p>

<p>
"I was drawin' away at my pipe, and not saying a

<p>
"He was all of a shake now, and his eyes was eyes
of terror, as he pointed aloft with outstretched arm.
</p>

<p>
"'Look! oh, look!'
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sure enough, cap'n, on the mizen topgallant
mast-head, burned a strange tapering light as tall as
a man's arm.
</p>

<p>
"We both stood mute with fear.  It burned brightly
for a minute, then flickered and went out.  Only to
reappear, however, in a few seconds, this time more
blue than white.  Then, flickering once more, it fled,
and we saw it not again.
</p>

<p>
"Neither spoke for long seconds.  We looked into
each others' faces inquiringly-like.
</p>

<p>
"'That,' said the bo's'n, 'is St. Helmo's (St. Elmo's)
fire, and this bloomin' ship is doomed.'
</p>

<p>
"I said nothing.  I merely walked below, and
passin' thro' the saloon entered the skipper's cabin and
touched him gentle-like on the shoulder.  Two candles
was burnin' in jimbles, and a book he had been reading
lay on the white coverlet.  Sound asleep as a baby he
were, but sailor-like he opened his eyes the moment I
touched him.
</p>

<p>

CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
THE BURNING SHIP.
</h3>

<p>
"At twelve o'clock," continued Goodwin, "I went
below to call old Deadlight, our first mate.
</p>

<p>
"When he came up, I stopped a few minutes to
talk to him and tell him what we'd seen, and the
captain's orders in case of getting too near the
Sargasso Sea.
</p>

<p>
"I was just slueing round to go below, when I
couldn't help thinking I felt smoke, like.
</p>

<p>
"At first the mate wouldn't have it.  It was my
imagination, he said.  I'd been thinking too much
about St. Elmo's fire, and all that rot.  I'd better go
and turn in, I should be better in the morning.  He
were just agoin' on like this and laughin' low to
hisself, when up the fore-hatch comes the bo's'n.
</p>

<p>
"'Beggin' your pardon, sir,' he said, 'but I think
the cargo is a-fire on the port side.'
</p>

<p>
"Deadlight and I hurried below now.  Yes, sure
enough, there was smoke coming up from the hold
through the crevices of the hatchway.
</p>

<p>
"The cap'n was called, and was on deck afore you
could have said 'binnacle'.
</p>

<p>
"He and the mate were very cool.  So was all
hands; and, cap'n, I always think it is a blessing when
the ship and precious lives are in danger not to have
any ladies on board, or longshore passenger swells.
They beat creation with the fuss they make.
</p>

<p>
"I was precious sorry now that I hadn't got steam
up instead of waitin' for the wind, for then we could
have turned it into the hold and soon put out the fire.
</p>

<p>
"All hands were called and the pumps were manned.
</p>

<p>
"We cut a hole in the fore-hatch of the hold, and
poured tons of water down.  But even there where we
stood our soles burned with heat, and we walked
cautiously lest we should fall through the
under-charred deck and be devoured by the fire below.
</p>

<p>
"I guess, cap'n, that the water we poured in just
sunk through a portion o' the cargo, like, and lay at
the bottom.
</p>

<p>
"It was an anxious time,&mdash;you bet your last rupee
on that, sir!&mdash;but all hands worked like grim death
in cholera times, and we hadn't time to funk.
</p>

<p>
"Hours and hours, taking turn and turn about.
Provisions and rum were got to the upper deck, and
water too, for it was evident that the skipper feared
the worst.  At the same time the boats were hoisted
to the davits and hung over the sea, all ready to let
go.  And they were provisioned, every one of the
three o' them, for ten days.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing was forgotten, gentlemen, that seamanship
could suggest.
</p>

<p>
"To our dismay we found that the fire was now
working farther aft, so we determined to clear the
after-hold of cargo.
</p>

<p>
"A working-party was at once organized, but, cap'n,
when the hatch was opened, such a stream of sparks
and such stiflin' clouds of smoke rolled up, that glad
was we when we got that hatch back in position.
</p>

<p>
"Fires was now well lit, though, and steam was
turned into the hold.
</p>

<p>
"This seemed to do good at first, and we worked
with redoubled vigour, singing merry sea-songs as we
did so.  But while so engaged, suddenly not only did
volumes of smoke roll up, but tongues of flame ten
feet high, that soon would have fired the middle-deck
had we not succeeded in battening it down.
</p>

<p>
"Our object was to keep the fire confined to the
hold, until we should succeed, if possible, in reaching
some of the islands of the Azores, there to beach her
and escape in our boats.
</p>

<p>
"It was not to be, although the boys worked like
African slaves.
</p>

<p>
"We scuppered the decks now in the cabin, and
down through the hole made thus, cap'n, we put the
nozzle of the hose.
</p>

<p>
"And so we worked away all that fearful night and
long into next forenoon.  We didn't think much
o' rest, gentlemen, nor food either.  We just choked
down a bit o' junk now and then, or a morsel o'
biscuit, and kept it down with a peg o' rum.  But,
bless you, sir, our eyes was burnin', our faces hangin'
in bags of blisters, and our mouths so dry by this
time that there was no good trying to sing, for we
were hardly fit to talk.
</p>

<p>
"Soon, now, the deck all along became so hot that
the men had to leave in relays to put their shoes on.
</p>

<p>
"The end came so suddenly that we was thunderstruck.
Somewhere near the fore-hatch the deck
blew up with the force of the steam.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, what a sight!  The clouds of smoke risin' as
high as the foretop, and the tongues of red flame
following and licking them up!
</p>

<p>
"About the same time the fire spread up out of the
scuppered hole, and the saloon was all in a blaze 'fore
ye could have said 'marling-spike'.  It was all over
now.
</p>

<p>
"But, next minute, and just as we was preparin'
to lower the boats, a white squall came thunderin'
over the sea, took the <i>Ossian</i> aback, and for five
minutes at least we stood holding on to the riggin' or
stays, while she went ploughin' astern.  We 'xpected,
cap'n, to see her go under, stern foremost, every minute.
Mebbe I was a bit white, cap'n.  I don't know, but
my pals was."
</p>

<p>
"It was really a fearful situation," said Captain
Leeward.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, and gettin' worse as the time went on,
for so long as the squall lasted the smoke and fire and
sparks flew over us.  But it stopped at last, and the
breeze came round the other way.
</p>

<p>
"Then we worked like devils, cap'n, to get her
afore it, and when we did it weren't quite so bad.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you know, gentlemen, a squall often brings
on dirty weather.  So did this.  Seemed to me it was
a choice o' deaths&mdash;to stay on board and sink with
the burnin' ship, or lower the boats to go to Davy
Jones in them.  There was more hope in the last idea,
so we lowered the boats one by one.  I insisted on
the skipper goin' in the gig&mdash;she was a good boat,&mdash;and
then came the lowerin' o' the last, and that was
the one, sir, that God's mercy enabled us to fetch you
in.
</p>

<p>
"The lowerin' o' a boat, as you know, sir, is a
ticklish thing in a heavy sea-way.  Somehow our
boat didn't take the water on an even keel, but stern
first, but we got her righted and scrambled in at last.
Night were a-comin' on now, cap'n, fast and dark, and
a dirty night it were bound to be.
</p>

<p>
"We had a compass in each boat, but not a rag of
a sail, just the oars; and so wild was the sea that,
what with keepin' her head on to the big coombing
waves that else would have sunk us, precious little
progress was made, I can assure you.
</p>

<p>
"We saw that burning ship an hour after we'd left
her.  Then she suddenly disappeared, and at the same
moment the roar of an explosion, louder 'n thunder,
rolled over the sea, and for the time being the waves
hadn't a chance o' bein' heard.
</p>

<p>
"About the beginning of the middle watch the
wind began to go down, and the sea too.  'I think,
boys,' I said to my pals, 'we can have a bite and a
sup, now.'  But, mercy on us, sir! when I bent down
to scramble for the provisions&mdash;none was there!  The
tack must have slipped overboard as we lowered the
boat stern first.
</p>

<p>
"There was a bottle o' rum, that was all.  I poured
out just a little, in the shell of an old silver watch my
poor mother had given me, and the men was thankful.
</p>

<p>
"But they was mostly exhausted, and I was feared
they'd sleep.  So, getting hold of some lanyard, I made
'em make the oars fast to the rowlocks, with freedom
to move and no more.
</p>

<p>
"In an hour's time the storm had passed away, and
the night was clear.  I put just two to the oars,
leaving two men to sleep and to relieve their pals when
they began to nod.  Good thing I'd tied the oars,
cap'n, for by an' by one poor beggar fell off the thwart
and I kicked up a sleeping chap to take his place.
</p>

<p>
"Well, now that the sea was quiet, steerin' was of
no account like.  I just told 'em to go on and keep
their weather eye on a certain star I pointed out.
</p>

<p>
"Then I curled up and slept like a stone.  It was
daybreak when I awoke.  There was a glittering
blood-red path across the waters where the crimson
sun was shinin'.  The sea was lumpy now, but the
day promised fine."
</p>

<p>
"Where were the other boats?"
</p>

<p>
"Not one, sir, to be seen near or far, and we've never
seen or overhauled them since.  This was a terrible
trial for us, as we had no food.  No, nor water.  On'y
the rum, that could only excite us and make us by
and by more wretched and unhappy.
</p>

<p>
"I put it to the vote, cap'n.  Should we drink the
rum or leave it till it was more wanted?  Right
bravely came the answer, ringing from for'ard:
</p>

<p>
"'We won't touch or taste it, till we ain't able to
sit up.'
</p>

<p>
"All that day we rowed as well as we could,
watchin' sea, watchin' sky, for a sight of a boat of our
own, for sight of a sail.  But the sun went down like
a great blood orange, and weary and faint now, we
hardly cared to row.
</p>

<p>
"There was neither moon nor stars that night, and
so I just lashed the helm so as to keep her driftin'
a kind of in her course.
</p>

<p>
"We stepped a little mast for'ard, and hung up our
lantern.  We blessed God that we had this, anyhow.
</p>

<p>
"Then we tumbled down to sleep, and long and
sound that sleep must have been, for it was the short
gray gloamin' o' mornin' when we pulled ourselves
together again.
</p>

<p>
"And what think you was the first thing my hot
eyes caught sight of?
</p>

<p>
"Why, cap'n, as sure as,&mdash;thanks to you!&mdash;I'm now
a livin' man, it was our own biggest boat&mdash;a kind o'
pinnace.  She was stove in at the bows, and bottom up."
</p>

<p>
"How could it have happened?" said Captain Leeward,
sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"She must have fouled the other boat, sir, and
without doubt both of the crews went to Davy Jones
together.  The skipper had been in the big boat.  Poor
chap! he leaves a young wife and three pretty kids.
</p>

<p>
"Our hearts sunk down, down after this.  No one
cared to speak much above his breath, and I noticed
more'n once that day, cap'n, the tears quietly streamin'
over the cheeks of a young sailor.  Our fate, we
feared, would be worse by far than that of our other
brave shipmates.
</p>

<p>
"I told out a watch-shell of rum all round at eight
bells, and we were a little heartened after this.
</p>

<p>
"But now, cap'n, the wind began to rise and moan
over the sea once more, and though it was right for us,
if it increased we couldn't keep her long afloat.  Well,
what does we do, sir, but tie two jackets together to
make a sail, and bent them on two oars.
</p>

<p>
"The poor fellows were half-dead now, and couldn't
have rowed two hours longer.  After a rest and a
kind of dreamy doze, we found the wind still higher,
and the seas breakin' on board of us all the time.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing for it now but bail her out.  We had two
pannikins and our sou'-westers, and wi' these we just
managed to keep her afloat till the second dog-watch.
</p>

<p>
"Another little tot o' rum at eight, and when the sea
and most o' the wind went down we bailed her out
once more, and then just tumbled down in the bottom,
wet, shivery, wretched.
</p>

<p>
"When day dawned, and there was still no sail nor
land in sight, we kind o' gave up in despair.  The
young sailor,&mdash;Tom Ball were his name,&mdash;sort of went
dotty, cap'n, and tried to eat the flesh oft the ball of
his thumb.  I gave him four watch-shells of rum, and
he sunk like a wet swab down between the thwarts.
Bill Jones took off his own coat and covered him up.
</p>

<p>
"We suffered more from thirst than hunger, though,
and Tom had drunk salt water, which sent him nearly
mad, you see.  So none o' the others touched it.
</p>

<p>
"I dozed again several times that day, and always
my dreams, cap'n, was the self-same.  I was wanderin'
among beautiful woods, near my own old home in
Berkshire, birds was singin' in the trees, there was
wild flowers all along the banks of a stream, and again
and again I stooped to drink, then all became dark
and dreadful and I awoke with a shriek.
</p>

<p>
"You don't mind me quotin' pottery, cap'n, do you?
For I really is main fond of it.

"I served out more rum towards evening.
</p>

<p>
"Having swallowed it, Mearns, an able-bodied seaman,
leant forward towards me and said hoarsely, with a
mad gleam in his bloodshot eyes:
</p>

<p>
"'Mate, we must cast lots who shall die, or shall we
chance it and kill the young un?"
</p>

<p>
"I prayed then, cap'n, as I'd never prayed before,
that God in his mercy would let us pass from life before
we woke.

<p>
"Then once more I dozed, once more I dreamt, and
again the green summer woods all a-wavin' in the
sunshine, the bird-song and the purlin' brook.
</p>

<p>
"But I had not slept long ere I was aroused.  It
was the young Tom Ball shriekin' in a strange
high-pitched voice&mdash;for his throat was as dry as emery
paper.
</p>

<p>
"'Mate, mate, mate!'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes, yes, here am I, boy.'
</p>

<p>
"'A ship, sir,&mdash;away down yonder!"
</p>

<p>
"I rubbed my eyes for a time, then saw your lights
through a kind of haze.
</p>

<p>
"'The lantern&mdash;quick!' I cried.
</p>

<p>
"It was handed me, and with my hand all a-shakin'
I brought out my match-box.
</p>

<p>
"O God, cap'n, there was but one lucifer there!
On this our lives depended, and I felt that, if I did not
succeed in lightin' that lamp, I myself should go mad
and throw myself into the sea, to be devoured by the
shark that, all throughout this weary time, had followed
in our wake.  I stood the hurricane-lantern under the
stern-sheets; then I put one hand holdin' the empty
box inside, lest a breath of air should blow out our only
hope.
</p>

<p>
"Then I struck the match.  A flare at first, then
only a tiny blaze of blue.  I turned it round, and its
light grew brighter and whiter.
</p>

<p>
"The lantern was lit, and Bill Jones seized it from
me, just as I fell down in the bottom of the boat in a
dead faint.
</p>

<p>
"Young Tom Ball crept aft to me, while Bill kept
waving the lantern on high.
</p>

<p>
"I was all doubled up, with my chin on my breast,
and but for that young fellow Tom I should have
died.  But he laid me flat out, and rubbed my chest
with rum, and when I sighed&mdash;a sad, sobbing kind
of sigh it were, so he says&mdash;he got me to swallow a
mouthful, and just as we got alongside your ship,
cap'n, I was able to sit up.
</p>

<p>
"And I knew we was saved, though I didn't know
then that the two hands lying asleep, like, in the bottom
of the boat, was dead."

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
GUN-ROOM FUN.
</h3>

<p>
If the reader&mdash;who I sincerely hope is going to be a
sailor, for there is no life like that on the ocean
wave&mdash;will take a glance at a map of the world and
ferret out Venezuela, he will note that by sailing
south-west by west in almost a bee-line for about 4700 miles,
he would strike this land of beauty, and land of flowers
and forests.
</p>

<p>
After leaving Azores, if his ship called there, he would
find himself in a long and lonesome sea indeed, and
after some weeks the Caribbean Islands would heave
in sight, and our young sailor would know then he was
far, far away from home.
</p>

<p>
Our own land&mdash;God bless it, and wouldn't you and
I fight for it just?&mdash;is but like the cloud of fog that
hangs over a city, compared to the loveliness of many
of these fairy isles.  The blue sky is fringed with the
tall palm-trees that shoot from the soil, the islands
themselves as you approach them appear to hang on
the horizon, and so azure is the ocean, so cerulean the
sky, you scarce can tell in fine weather where they
meet and kiss.
</p>

<p>
The water around one's yacht or ship is sometimes
so clear, so pellucid, that you see the bottom full ten
fathoms beneath, where corals lie deep, where gorgeous
and magnificently coloured shell-fish move slowly
about, where marine gardens&mdash;more lovely far than
any on earth,&mdash;planted and attended to by mermaids
one would think, dazzle the eyes and delight the senses,
and where on clear yellow patches of sand you may
see flat fishes float, their sides so bedecked with patches
of bright crimson, orange, and blue, that you cannot
help thinking there must be a fish's fancy-dress ball on.
</p>

<p>
Then between you and the bottom float medusæ or
jelly-fishes&mdash;bigger and more transparent than even
those in Skye, for the limbs of these seem to be
rainbow-tinted, or studded with gems of purest ray serene,
diamonds, rubies, and amethysts.  Yet all the creatures
in that submarine garden wide and wild are not beautiful.
Perhaps you are lying in a boat, gazing down
through your water-telescope entranced, and half
believing you will presently see a mermaid come out of
a little cave combing her bonnie yellow hair, when,
instead of the tiny mermaid, some patches of
black-brown weeds are visibly stirred, and an awful head
with fore-fins or fore-feet and claws, you cannot tell
which, is protruded.  Oh that deformed, scaly, warty
head and these awful eyes, bearing some faint resemblance
to a nightmarish caricature of man or fiend!
If you are a nervous lad you will think and dream
about this slimy apparition for weeks.
</p>

<p>
Well, all around Bermuda the rocks and sea-gardens
are almost quite as lovely.  Had the <i>Osprey</i>
been going straight to Venezuela it would have been
out of her course to stop here, but she had despatches
to leave.
</p>

<p>
Two of the <i>Ossian's</i> shipwrecked crew were left
there, but the mate begged to be allowed to remain
and the captain had no objections.  Goodwin was a
naval reserve man, and even a lieutenant in that
service.
</p>

<p>
This mate of a merchantman was in some ways
a singular being, for although I think that the
English he spoke was often rude, he could talk the
language purely when he chose.  Moreover, he was
a student of gunnery, and could have worked a gun
with any officer afloat.  He was made an honorary
member of the warrant officers' mess, and having no
particular duties to perform, he spent most of his time
making models of the newest guns and machinery
of great iron-clads.  Having got together, with the
aid of the gunner and carpenter, some nice models,
he announced in the gun-room that he was willing
to give lessons to the midshipmen therein which
would be of use to them when war's pennant floated
red and bloody over the main.  And many availed
themselves of the kind offer, chief among them being
Creggan himself and the Ugly Duckling&mdash;more about
the latter presently.  But even some of the ward-room
officers, and now and then the captain himself,
would look on as this ultra-enthusiast in naval warfare
described the play of a battle of giant iron-clads,
and the use of the terrible guns.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, boys," he would say, "there was much romance
attached to the glorious days of Nelson, when hostile
fleets lay in rows, mebbe two deep, one to support
t'other like.  When it was ship to ship, and hammer
and tongs till one blazed, blew up, and sank, or when
the skipper of a Britisher shouted through his trumpet
to the master at the wheel: 'Lay us aboard that
frog-eating Frenchman!'  When the master steered so
close to the foe that guns met muzzle to muzzle, and
high o'er the din o' battle rang out the order: 'Away,
boarders!  Give the beggars Rule Britannia, lads!'  The
days when our brave blue-jackets used to swarm
over the sides of the enemy's ship, or creep in through
the ports, pistol in hand, cutlass in mouth perhaps,
and lay the Frenchees dead at their guns.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, boys, these were the dashin' days of old, and
somehow I sighs w'en I think they're gone.
</p>

<p>
"But the future sea-fights, young gents, are goin'
to be fought with cool heads on sturdy shoulders.
Excitement or rashness will mean annihilation;
manoeuvring will be prominent, ay, and pre-eminent."
</p>

<p>
Here Goodwin would pause perhaps, look funnily
down at his models and smile.
</p>

<p>
"You may think it a droll remark o' me to make,
lads, but I do believe that, given two hostile battleships,
encountering each other, then that skipper who
is a good whist player, and has a long head that can
see a bit into futurity as it were, or guesses before-hand
what t'other chap will do when he, the whist
man, plays his next card, will win the game o' war.
</p>

<p>
"This will kind o' knock some o' the romance out
o' naval warfare.  But not so much as we may think.
Moral courage, mind you, boys, is of a far higher sort
of quality than physical.  And altho' the poet asks&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'And how can man die better,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than facing fearful odds,<br />
  For the ashes of his fathers<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the temples of his gods?'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
one might answer him thus: He may die more truly
courageously, more bravely too, if calm, if he meets
his fate on a sinking iron-clad man-o'-war."
</p>

<p class="t3">

<p>
After their visit to Bermuda, and a delightful
ramble through the beautiful island, Creggan was
glad enough to find himself steering south and away
via Puerto Rico, and bearing up for Venezuela.  For
the sea had already cast a glad glamour over the
young man's life and soul.
</p>

<p>
Whenever he had time he wrote long delightful
letters to his mother, to Daddy the hermit, to Archie,
and to the Nugents, as well as to the manse.  Perhaps
his best and dearest of letters were those received by
Matty.  For Creggan couldn't help loving the child,
and often he used to dream of her when far away at
sea.  Somehow she always appeared to him sitting in
the stern of the skiff, her bonnie yellow hair toyed
with by the breeze, and her eyes glistening with joy
and happiness.
</p>

<p>
It was not pleasant, however, to be awakened from
such a delightful dream at the dark hour of midnight
to go on deck to keep watch on an angry sea.
</p>

<p>
It is needless to say that Creggan's letters were
received at home with joy, read over and over again,
and even laid aside for future perusal.
</p>

<p>
Goodwin was frequently invited to spend an evening
in the gun-room mess, and these were red-letter
nights for the middies, for this warlike mate of a
merchantman could even make the sallow-faced young
clerk smile.  As for the Ugly Duckling, he smiled
aloud till the beams rung and the plates on the table
wanted to skip like lambs.
</p>

<p>
This midshipman's mess was always a merry one.
Guns may change their form in the service, and ships
as well, but our bold blue-jackets, and our daft,
fun-loving and gallant middies, will never change as long
as Britain's flag is unfurled,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "To brave the battle and the breeze".<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Creggan, though somewhat older than midshipman
Robertson, the plain-faced lad whose sense of humour
nevertheless carried his mess-mates by storm, liked the
droll boy very much, and they were together on shore
whenever there was a chance.  Along with them
usually went the gentle Sidney Wickens.
</p>

<p>
Poor Sidney&mdash;he is dead and gone now&mdash;enjoyed a
joke but never played one, but his smile was very
pleasant, and at times even sad.  He had, however, a
quiet, quaint way of putting things that often made his
mess-mates laugh.  His fad during this cruise, as well
as in the flag-ship at Sheerness, was the collection of
beautiful gold rings.  He often asked one or two of
the warrant officers to look at these of an evening.
And if the bo's'n, for instance, particularly fancied and
admired one, Sidney would quietly hand it over his
shoulder, saying, "Here, will you accept it, and wear
it for my sake?"
</p>

<p>
Gun-room officers are fond of chaff, and unsparing
in the use of it, no matter how it gives offence or how
it is taken.  But they always like best when the
banter is returned.  There is the banterer and the
banteree, and woe betide the latter if he gets angry!
</p>

<p>
I believe Sidney&mdash;he was always called by his
Christian name in a kindly, brotherly way, and
somehow no one ever chaffed him&mdash;Sidney, I was going to
say, was often sorry for the Ugly Duckling.  But
nothing could possibly upset the Ugly Duckling
himself.  Not even Bobbie's chaff.  So good-natured was
this droll duckling, that his extreme and quaint
ugliness was really never observable.  And his
manner was as soft and gentle as that of a young girl,
except when his soul was just bursting with fun and
merriment, then he used to take to the rigging with
Admiral Jacko to expand his extra steam, and allay his
feelings.
</p>

<p>
A question whether Admiral Jacko or Duckie was
the uglier, at times arose in the mess, even in the lad's
presence.  One day midshipmite Bobbie had the cheek
to ask the Duckling to sit side by side with the
Admiral during dinner, so that the right conclusion
might be arrived at, and our friend did so readily
and good-naturedly.
</p>

<p>
The Ugly Duckling is, you will readily believe
when I tell you, a sketch from the life, and now that
my memory brings him once more up before my mind's
eye, I believe I am right in asserting that poor
Mr. Duckling's face was more droll than ugly.  Somewhat
difficult to describe too.  Forehead receded somewhat;
nose nowhere, or hardly anywhere; eyes half-shut and
full of fun; plenty of cheek, moral and physical; a
longish, protruding upper lip; and an immense square
jaw.  His ears stuck out too, like lug-sails.
</p>

<p>
"Mind, Mr. Ugly Duckling," Bobbie told him one
day at mess, "you must never get lost on the coast of
Benin."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Scottie?"
</p>

<p>
"Why?  How can you ask?  Forgotten all your
history?  The king of Benin, you know, always nails
his captives by the ears to a tree, and your ears you
know, <i>mon ami</i>, are wonderfully suggestive!"
</p>

<p>
That day when the Duckling sat beside Admiral
Jacko there was a good deal of amusement.  The
Admiral, I may tell you, was a very large and by no
means handsome species of ape, and though he could
not use a knife and fork, he ate most contentedly
from the plate that M'Carthy the steward always
placed before him, and he even used a table-napkin.
On this particular day he more than once put his
head cheek-by-jowl with the Duckling's, and the
merriment increased.
</p>

<p>
The Admiral was exceedingly fond of the Ugly Duckling.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, look, mess-mates, look, now that their heads
are together!"  This from Bobbie.  "Why, I declare
that Jacko takes the cake!"
</p>

<p>
"For ugliness?"
</p>

<p>
"No; for beauty, boys!"
</p>

<p>
But Admiral Jacko had another very dear friend,
namely, the ship's cat, a beautiful, half-bred brindled
Persian.
</p>

<p>
After every meal Jacko used to collect tit-bits and
stuff them into his jowl till his cheek stuck out, then
he went at once in search of pussy and fed him.  The
action was almost human.  Indeed it might have been
called more so, for the "lower animals", as we are all
too fond of calling them, often exhibit more kindness
to each other than mankind does to any of them.
</p>

<p>
There was something quite out of the common about
Jacko in many ways.  He really had less mischief in his
mental composition than monkeys generally.  Hurricane
Bob and Oscar used to be washed regularly once a
week.  The gun-room steward, superintended by Creggan
himself, used to perform this operation.  After
the rubbing and rinsing with warm water and soap,
they were always deluged with pailfuls of clear, soft
water, and after they were dried down with half a
dozen towels&mdash;the dogs' own property&mdash;they were
combed and brushed.
</p>

<p>
Then ensued a wild scamper round and round the
<i>Osprey's</i> decks, that made everyone laugh who saw
it.
</p>

<p>
Admiral Jacko used to squat on top of the capstan
while the doggies were being washed, and from the
long, doleful face he wore, it was evident he pitied them.
But as soon as the scamper up and down the decks
after belaying-pins that the men threw to them was
over, both dogs went and lay down on the quarter-deck
in the sunshine.  And now Jacko considered that his
duties had commenced.  He would leap solemnly down
from the top of the capstan, Creggan would hand him
the comb, then off he went to his friends the dogs.
No peasant woman in Normandy could have combed
her boy's hair more carefully than did Jacko go over
Hurricane Bob's coat first, and then honest Oscar's,
with finger-nails and brush.  Well, if he did catch an
errant flea it was executed on the spot; but the
earnestness with which Jacko did the work, and the
exceeding gravity of his face while at it, would have
drawn laughter from a California mule.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
I myself have never yet seen a more active middy
on board a British man-o'-war than the Ugly Duckling
was.  No part of the ship's rigging was inaccessible
to him.  He would climb to the main-truck and wave
his cap to those below.
</p>

<p>
One day, however, he attempted a feat that, although
he had often performed it in harbour, was undoubtedly
dangerous at sea, even on the calmest day.  The sea
all around that forenoon was as still and quiet as the
grave, and the <i>Osprey</i> was on an even keel.  They
were now nearing the north coast of South America,
and though steam was up, and the ship churning up
a long wake of froth that trailed for miles in the rear,
it made no other motion save vibration.  Well, Jacko
and the Ugly Duckling had been having fine fun that
forenoon, much to the delight of those below.  Up
aloft they went, to top after top, and down again to
deck by a back-stay.  Hand over hand up that back-stay
again, and so on, seeming to have no tire in
them.  But at last, to the horror, it must be said, of
the officers on the quarter-deck, the Ugly Duckling
slowly drew himself up to the top of the gilded truck,
and then slowly and cautiously stood up.
</p>

<p>
There was no laughing now among those below, all
were mute with fears for the poor boy's fate.  This
daring middy balanced himself first on one foot and
then on the other, and then&mdash;will it be believed?&mdash;he
took from his jacket pocket a tiny ebony fife, at
playing which he was a great adept, and commenced to
pipe <i>The Girl I left behind me</i>.
</p>

<p>
He never finished the tune, however.
</p>

<p>
Something had suddenly unnerved him, and well he
knew that to fall deckwards would be death.  He
was seen, therefore, to suddenly crouch, and putting
his hands in swimming fashion above his head, to
spring into the air.  He came down like a flash, and
sunk far into the water, many yards on the port side
of the ship.
</p>

<p>
"Away, life-boat's crew!"
</p>

<p>
Never, perhaps, was that life-boat launched more
speedily.  A life-buoy, too, had been thrown overboard.
</p>

<p>
The Ugly Duckling was too good a swimmer, however,
to need such assistance, only he kept close to it,
as he did not wish it to be lost.
</p>

<p>
Now the great danger was the sharks, cruel tigers
of the seas, that in these hot latitudes swarm.
</p>

<p>
But the boat picked the middy up just at the very
moment that two monster sharks sprang at the
life-buoy and hauled it down.
</p>

<p>
The Ugly Duckling had stuck to his fife all the time,
and now much to the amusement of the life-boat's crew
commenced once more to play <i>The Girl I left behind
me</i>, and continued to play till the boat got alongside.
Then up ran the still dripping Duckling, and on gaining
the quarter-deck first saluted it and then saluted
Captain Leeward.
</p>

<p>
"Come to report myself, sir," he said, "for leaving
the ship without leave."
</p>

<p>
"And I ought to punish you, sir," said the captain,
trying in vain to suppress a smile; "but I will forgive
you if you promise not to stand on the truck again."
</p>

<p>
"I promise, sir, readily; for, sir, it wouldn't be half
good enough to be swallowed by a shark, fife and all."
</p>

<p>
And down below dived this queer middy to change
his dripping garments.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
JACKO STEALS THE CAPTAIN'S PUDDING.
</h3>

<p>
It would take a good many chapters to tell my
readers all the tricks that this favourite of the
gun-room mess played.
</p>

<p>
The surgeon, Dr. Grant, and he were excellent friends,
and were often together; and sometimes if one of his
mess-mates was a bit off colour, the Ugly Duckling
would prescribe or pretend to prescribe for him, and
his prescriptions were at times droll, to say the least.
</p>

<p>
One day, for instance, the white-faced young clerk
was ailing.  He frequently was.
</p>

<p>
"No use you going to Dr. Grant," said the Duckling;
"he'll only give you black-strap and make you worse.
Here, out with your note-book and I'll dictate a
prescription.  Are you ready?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Duckie."
</p>

<p>
"Well then, heave round: '<i>Recipe</i>'.  Got that down?
It's Latin, you know, so have a care, but all the rest
is English.  Place a saucepan on the galley fire, and
when it is heated to redness pour therein seven ounces
of spirits of wine."
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"When it comes to the boil place therein the tail of
a toad&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But toads have got no tails."
</p>

<p>
"Well, a frog's tail will do."
</p>

<p>
"And frogs have no tails, Duckie.  You're a bit off
your natural history."
</p>

<p>
"Well," cried the Duckling, "a garden worm will do.
That's all tail.  Got 'im down?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Next, place in your cauldron a hair of the dog that
bit you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And next&mdash;mind, this is very important, and will
greatly aid the efficacy of the medicine&mdash;five drops of
the sweat of a murderer's right hand."
</p>

<p>
The white-faced young clerk glared up aghast.
</p>

<p>
"Wh&mdash;wh&mdash;why," he faltered, "there is no murderer
on board!"
</p>

<p>
"Well then, kill somebody yourself!" shouted the
Ugly Duckling.  "Ta-ta!  I'm off to give the doctor a
dancing lesson on the main-deck."
</p>

<p>
Well, that was precisely what he was doing five
minutes after.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Grant was a splendid dancer of Highland flings
and reels, &amp;c., but, good-looking fellow though he was,
he would have told you himself that he always felt a
fool at an English ball or hop, and he hated being a
wall-flower.
</p>

<p>
So the Ugly Duckling had offered to teach him, and
had you come forward on the fighting-deck during
practising-time, you would have seen a sight to amuse
you.  There was the chief bo's'n, a capital violinist,
seated astraddle on one of the big guns, and playing
some sweet, sad waltz, and yonder the little Duckling
and the great Scotch doctor floating round and round
the deck, with an awkwardness, however, that caused
all the onlookers to shout with merriment.
</p>

<p>
The doctor didn't laugh a bit.  It was a very serious
matter for him indeed.  His happiness was at stake;
so he stuck to it, and tripped on the not very light
fantastic toe.
</p>

<p>
His assiduity was finally rewarded, however, and
he became one of the best dancers on board, and on
shore was quite a favourite with the ladies.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
At first the great monkey had been simply called
Jacko, or Able-seaman Jacko.  But the Duckling
determined to raise him to the rank of admiral.  First
and foremost, however, he took no small pains in
teaching his simian friend to walk erect.  This he
soon learned.  Then to salute, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
After he was perfect in these accomplishments
Jacko's promotion came.  Well, you know, reader, it
isn't the first time one of a ship's crew has risen from
powder-monkey to admiral.
</p>

<p>
Then why shouldn't Jacko?  Why not indeed?
</p>

<p>
The Duckling took up some nice ship's serge and
buttons and gold-lace from the paymaster, and then
he made friends with the ship's tailor.  In less than
a week after this, behold Jacko rigged out in the
full-dress of a rear-admiral, cocked-hat, sword, and
all.
</p>

<p>
No ward-room officer except Dr. Grant was "in the
know", and the doctor good-naturedly gave the Duckling
the use of the sick-bay for training purposes, and
for the practice of their evolutions.
</p>

<p>
I verily believe, from the aptitude to learn which
Jacko evinced, that the droll rascal was not a little
proud of his splendid uniform and epaulettes.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, his education was soon complete.  So one
evening, as the captain, all alone in his quarters, was
bending over a chart&mdash;the ship being then not far
from land,&mdash;Bobbie, the wee Scotch midshipmite, who
was a great favourite with Captain Leeward, knocked
smartly at his door and quickly entered.
</p>

<p>
"An admiral come off to see you, sir!" he squeaked.
"Shall I show him in?"
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly, Mr. Robertson.  But&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And the captain rose in some agitation, and pushed
back his chair.
</p>

<p>
The state of his feelings may be better conceived
than printed when in marched Admiral Jacko.
</p>

<p>
Jacko took off his cocked hat, and bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;ha&mdash;ah&mdash;ha," the monkey said, for all the
world like a nervous man beginning a speech, and held
out his little black hand as if to shake.
</p>

<p>
Bobbie stuffed his mouth with his handkerchief.
It would have been rude to laugh before his captain,
but when the latter threw himself down in his chair in
an apparent state of convulsions, then the midshipmite
laughed too, and even the captain's steward could not
refrain from joining the chorus.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes after this the ship seemed shaken
from stem to stern by the wild hilarity of the
ward-room officers.  They had been at their dessert when
Bobbie introduced the Admiral.
</p>

<p>
The best of it all was, that Jacko himself looked as
grave as an Oxford don.  Never a smile was on his
face.  Not even the ghost of one.
</p>

<p>
But the new admiral was given a chair and a plate,
and, behaving himself with all decorum, enjoyed a
hearty feast of nuts and raisins.  After this,
accompanied by Bobbie, he bowed and took his leave.  He
had taken good care, however, to stuff one of his cheeks
with nuts before he got down off his chair, till it stuck
out like&mdash;so the doctor phrased it&mdash;a very bad case of
inflammation of the parotid gland.
</p>

<p>
Admiral Jacko, it must be admitted, was a very
funny fellow, but I fear I could not certify that he
was strictly honest.  Real rear-admirals would never,
for instance, do what Admiral Jacko did once.  He
was on the fighting-deck one day, and noticed the
captain's steward pass into the saloon with a nice
little plum-pudding.
</p>

<p>
Jacko, in full uniform, walked past the door several
times and had a sniff, the sentry smiling and presenting
arms to him.  But presently an officer entered to
inform the captain that a strange man-o'-war was in
sight, and leaving his luncheon he went on deck to
have a look at her.  This was the Rear-admiral's
chance.  He rushed in and as quickly came out again,
hugging the brown and savoury pudding in his arms.
</p>

<p>
The sentry didn't present arms to him this time,
only he determined not to tell upon poor Jacko.
</p>

<p>
"Bring in the pudding, steward," said Captain Leeward.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir, I brought it!"
</p>

<p>
"Then where is it?"
</p>

<p>
"That's what I should like to know, sir!"
</p>

<p>
He clapped his hand to his head, and for a moment
looked confused.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir," he cried next minute, "I'd lay my life if
you'd let me, sir, that Admiral Jacko has collared it!
Shall I run and hunt him up and recover it?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, steward; it wouldn't be much worth by this
time."
</p>

<p>
And, sure enough, there was Admiral Jacko in the
main-top discussing that delicious "plum-duff", with
half-shut eyes and all the airs and graces of an
epicure.  After he had eaten all he could swallow, he
stuffed both cheeks, pitched the remains down on the
head of an able seaman, then slid down a stay to
find and feed the cat.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
On the whole, then, I think it must be admitted
that the <i>Osprey</i> was rather a happy ship.
</p>

<p>
When they neared the coast of Venezuela they had
the good luck to fall in with the flag-ship of the
station.  Captain Leeward delivered his despatches
and letters for officers and crew, and then to his
surprise found that the admiral had a cablegram for him.
It was to the effect that he, Captain Leeward, was to
join the South American fleet for a few months.  This
was on account of a cloud that was gathering in
Venezuela concerning disputed British possessions on
the borders.  At that time the cloud was no bigger
than a man's hand, but it might spread till it covered
all the sky, and darken even our relations with the
United States of America, whose president was
apparently spoiling for a fight with Britain.
</p>

<p>
The fleet was to hold itself in readiness to land
blue-jackets and marines at any moment.
</p>

<p>
So they all went cruising together.
</p>

<p>
The poor Irish "stupidnumerary" was transferred
for service to a tiny gun-vessel, and very sorry indeed
he was to part with his mess-mates.  For, bar chaff,
they had all been as happy together as a summer's
day is long.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
For months the fleet hovered around the coast, only
putting out to sea now and then if a storm threatened
to blow them on to a lee-shore.  But there was much
intercourse between the various ships, and at the
towns they anchored near, the inhabitants were most
hospitable.  The flag-ship often gave a dinner or a
dance on the upper deck, which was tented over in its
after part, and gay with flags and flowers and
perfumed foliage.
</p>

<p>
What a happy, jolly life is that of a young naval
officer on occasions like these, and how quickly, while
waltzing with some lovely young girl to dreamy
music, does he forget all the dangers of the ocean that
he has come through!
</p>

<p>
He just lives for the present.  And oh! that present
glides far, far too quickly away, yet it is something to
look back to with pleasure when once more he is out
upon the lone blue sea!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
IN THE WILDS OF VENEZUELA.
</h3>

<p>
Although the <i>Osprey's</i> visit to Venezuela may
have but little interest for the reader, still it
would be unfair to drag him away from that land
without first inviting him on shore to have a look at
some of its wild and lovely scenery.
</p>

<p>
A young fellow&mdash;a Spaniard, though he talked
capital English&mdash;came off one forenoon.  He was
received by Creggan and the Duckling at the gangway,
and after talking for a short time on deck they invited
him below.
</p>

<p>
This Spaniard was a gentleman in every sense of
the word, and possessed of all that old Castalian
courtesy and urbanity which you see so little of in
these matter-of-fact days.  He owned, too, that he
was independent, if not indeed rich.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, señor," he said to Creggan, "think you that
your captain would permit you to spend a few weeks
on shore with me?  And your dear friend here?  I
will do all I can to make you happy."
</p>

<p>
"I do not doubt that for a moment," said Creggan,
"and if we can succeed in getting leave we are at
your command."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I rejoice!" cried young Miguel.
</p>

<p>
"I myself," he added, "am bound up in botany, in
sport, and in natural history.  Ah! we will enjoy our
little selves, see if we don't!"
</p>

<p>
Leave was asked for and granted that very day.
The <i>Osprey</i> was going down the coast and would
leave them here, returning again in three weeks'
time.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said dark-eyed young Miguel, "that does
mean six, my capitan.  You look good, and good you
must be."
</p>

<p>
The captain smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, señor, Venezuela is a vast country!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, Miguel, I'll let the young fellows oft
for five or six weeks.  I think they will be safe with
you, and it will do them both good."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, safe, sir, as the everlasting mountains.  And
I have two houses&mdash;one is my yacht, and the other
my dwelling on shore on the banks of the great
Orinoco.  You have no such rivers in Britain, I
believe, señor capitan?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, no," replied Leeward, smiling.  "You see,
we are somewhat cramped for space, and a river
broader than any of our two counties we should find
somewhat inconvenient, to say the least."
</p>

<p>
"A thousand thanks for the leave, sir!" cried
Creggan impulsively.
</p>

<p>
Then he added:
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, sir, but you are so different from
Commander Flint."
</p>

<p>
Well, Creggan and the Ugly Duckling had as many
good-byes and hand-shakings given them as if they
had been going off for a whole year to fight for their
Queen and country.
</p>

<p>
The Duckling's parting from Admiral Jacko was
quite affecting, as far as feeling on the part of this
strange but clever ape went.  Perhaps from his
excessive and droll ugliness Jacko looked upon the
middy as a brother.  Be that as it may, he hung
with his arms around his neck and his cheek against
the Duckling's, and the expression of his face was so
sad that the gun-room officers would not have been at
all surprised had he burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
"Take care of my brother Jacko, boys!"
</p>

<p>
These were the Ugly Duckling's last words as he
seated himself in Miguel's boat, and the sturdy
semi-Spanish sailors bent bravely to their work.  Out there,
where the <i>Osprey</i> lay at anchor near to a small but
beautiful island, there was a kind of "jabble" of small
waves, caused by cross seas and currents.  But after
bearing in towards the green-fringed shore for about
three miles, the men singing as they rowed to the
sweet, soft notes of a guitar touched by the fingers of
Miguel himself, they rounded another island, and were
soon lost to view from the deck of the <i>Osprey</i>.
</p>

<p>
The water was now more smooth, though the outward
current ran high.  The tide in fact was ebbing.
When it flows here it flows fast and furiously, and
there are times when the battle betwixt sea and river
is so furious, that no boat could float in the turmoil of
breaking waters.
</p>

<p>
The Orinoco is undoubtedly a grand river, though
certainly not so wide as Captain Leeward would lead
one to infer.  It is a grand stream, and a wildly
romantic one too&mdash;higher up, I mean, for, like the
river Nile, it forms a delta.  This is about one hundred
and thirty miles from the wide Atlantic, and here it
divides itself into a great number of mouths, most of
them navigable.
</p>

<p>
The principal mouth or main-stream is called the
Boca de Navios, and it was up this great stream that
our heroes went with Miguel next morning, in his
pretty little steam-yacht, of which the young fellow
was so justly proud.
</p>

<p>
So light was this craft and so little water did she
draw, that she could go anywhere, and being strong
even in a buffeting sea-way, could have done
anything.  She was not, however, quite so light as the
Yankee's boat that was warranted to sail wherever
there was a heavy dew.
</p>

<p>
I am writing from memory only, so I cannot give
the exact tonnage of the <i>Orinoco Queen</i>, but fifty tons
is near enough.  Her beam was broad, though.  Her
little cabin or cuddy quite a lady's boudoir, adorned
and perfumed with the rarest tropical flowers, through
which at night peeped coyly the glow of fairy-lights.
The one great lamp that swung from the skylight had
a crimson shade, and thus the cabin looked like a scene
from dream-land.
</p>

<p>
At night Miguel played his guitar, and sang wild
and martial ballads of the romantic Spain of years
gone by, or soft lullaby-like love ditties.  The music
of these latter seemed to breathe o'er the strings.  You
could have told it was a serenade, and in imagination
you might have seen a beautiful girl-face appear one
moment at an open lattice-window above, and next,
from a white and shapely hand extended, you might
imagine a flower drop down, to be rapturously caught
and pressed to the lips of the serenader.  Spain,
deprived of its romance, were nothing now.
</p>

<p>
Hammocks were hung on deck, and surrounded, as
far as Miguel's guests were concerned, by mosquito
curtains.  But the captain, Miguel himself, slept on
a grass mat.
</p>

<p>
The crew of the <i>Orinoco Queen</i> consisted of five
men and a boy, two of the men being engineers.  This
little river craft, however, had a main and fore mast,
on which were carried, alow and aloft only, fore-and-aft
sails.  The men were lanky and brown, dark in
hair and eyes, with bare necks and chests, and legs all
exposed below the knees.  But they were as lithe and
active as panthers.
</p>

<p>
From the very first Creggan and the Duckling
knew that they were going to have a real good time
of it.  Miguel believed in taking life easy.  With
half-shut eyes, while the yacht steamed slowly up the
river, he would lie or recline on a grass hammock
on deck, a small perfumed cigar between his lips,
making little else save interjectional remarks for an
hour at a time.
</p>

<p>
Miguel had no middle-mind, if I may so express it;
that is, he was either dreamy happy in a kind of
lethargy, or as active as a pole-cat on the war-path.
</p>

<p>
In this respect he resembled the monster caymans,
or huge alligators with which the yellow-white waters
of the river swarmed.  Terrible monsters indeed these
are!  You can see their great heads protruding over
the moon-lit water, if you are keeping the middle
watch.  So lazy look they, that scarcely could you
believe that anything could excite them, or wake
them into activity.  But let a man fall overboard,
or&mdash;awful accident!&mdash;a boat capsize, and they cleave the
water, quick as seals, and Heaven have mercy on the
mariners, for the caymans have none!
</p>

<p>
In five days' time, taking it very easy, and often-times
landing on wooded islands, or at the mouths of
rivers&mdash;tributaries to the "Mother of Waters",&mdash;they
reached Ciudad Bolivar.
</p>

<p>
Both the Ugly Duckling and Creggan were fond of
the beautiful in nature, and everything they saw on
the pretty arboreal islands which they touched at
was new and strange.  Many of these were inhabited,
and the languid natives, who lived in thatch huts of
wattle and clay, existing for the most part on fish, I
think, were exceedingly kind to them.  They brought
them light wine, fruit, eggs, fish, and goat's milk.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes on a day of racing clouds and sunshine,
Miguel would cast anchor at the mouth of a tributary
river, and in his boat would start up stream with his
guests.
</p>

<p>
Such rivers were wondrously beautiful.  The overhanging
trees, laden down with green foliage till the
tips of the branches touched the water, were cloud-lands
of a beauty that was rich and rare.  For not
only were their leaves a sight to see, but the climbing
flowers that often bound them into great crimson, blue,
or orange garlands, dazzled the eyes with their loveliness.
</p>

<p>
I said the branches bent downwards, yes, and formed
cool sylvan arbours, in which the boat could lie for
luncheon.
</p>

<p>
Miguel&mdash;kind-hearted he was and thoughtful&mdash;had
forgotten nothing that could minister to the comfort
of his guests, and serve to make this visit to Venezuela
an ever-memorable one.
</p>

<p>
The mosquitoes of these regions are very lively little
persons, and very fond of British blood, but a tincture
that Miguel gave to the boys with which to rub face
and hands, kept them well at bay.
</p>

<p>
After luncheon Miguel would sing and play for an hour.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the great snakes that lay sometimes all
their length on the branches above, or hung head down
therefrom, were no source of comfort either to Creggan
or his friend.  They could not keep from looking at
them at first, fearful lest they might drop into the
boat; and these serpents are deadly monsters.
</p>

<p>
"Do not look, my friends," said Miguel; "they may
fascinate you."
</p>

<p>
"Is that story about fascination not all a myth?"
said Creggan.
</p>

<p>
Miguel leaned forward and lit another cigarette
before he replied: "Not so, Creggan.  I have heard
many stories of the power these monsters possess over
the minds of men.
</p>

<p>
"But," he added, "one I do remember personally.
I and a friend from Trinidad were hunting the panther
in a piece of forest-land far away north of here, and
among the Llanos[<a id="chap22fn1text"></a><a href="#chap22fn1">1</a>].
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap22fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap22fn1text">1</a>] Tracks of uplands, covered with wild grass, trees, &amp;c.,
and with cañons between.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"We came to a snake-infested jungle, but being very
tired we determined to camp there for the night.  We
tied our donkeys to leafless cocoanut-trees, that looked
at a distance like masts of ships.  Then we swung our
grass hammocks ready, and cooked supper.
</p>

<p>
"We were only on the borders of the ugly jungle.
Yet it contained game-birds, and in pursuit of these
Antoine and I entered its gloom.  We got several,
and were returning to our camp, I being about ten
yards ahead of my companion.  Suddenly&mdash;it makes
me shudder even now&mdash;I heard my friend utter that
strange quavering low scream that issues from a man
in nightmare.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oo&mdash;oo&mdash;hoo&mdash;oo!</i>
</p>

<p>
"I turned quickly.  There stood poor Antoine, a
huge snake depending from a tree not a yard from his
face, and evidently about to strike.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-216"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-216.jpg" alt="ANTOINE WAS IN A STATE OF MESMERIC FASCINATION, AND PALE AS DEATH" />
<br />
ANTOINE WAS IN A STATE OF MESMERIC FASCINATION, <br />
AND PALE AS DEATH
</p>

<p>
"Antoine was in a state of mesmeric fascination&mdash;visage
pale as death, staring upturned eyes, arms
straight down by his side, and clenched hands.
</p>

<p>
"I fired at once, and the snake fell with shattered
head, but writhing, leaping, and dancing body.
</p>

<p>
"A snake, my friends, never looks more hideous than
when, headless, he twists and coils in the thraldom of
death.
</p>

<p>
"My friend Antoine had fainted, but though he soon
revived I noted something strange in his manner.  It
put me in mind of the childish hysterical nervousness
of speech and movement a wine-bibber sometimes exhibits.
</p>

<p>
"But I marked also, that whenever that day he saw
a huge snake hanging on a tree, he would stop and
gaze at it with dilated eyes, and even after passing on
he would turn again and again to look once more
into the ever-open glassy eyes of the serpent.
</p>

<p>
"My friends, the worst was to come.  I may tell
you first, that the nights at this time were brightly
moonlit.  Well, we supped and turned into our hammocks,
but after I had slept for hours I awoke suddenly
with a strange kind of fear and coldness at my heart.
</p>

<p>
"I naturally glanced towards Antoine's hammock.
It was too loose and puckered to have anyone in it.
</p>

<p>
"My friend had fled!
</p>

<p>
"I turned out at once and roused my men, and
together we hurried down through a bit of savannah
to the jungle.  I was hoping against hope.  But to all
our shouting no response was given, except from the
throats of wild beasts.  We returned to camp now
disheartened, to await the coming of daylight.
</p>

<p>
"At last, dear friends, the sun's crimson rays darted
through the deep orange hue on the horizon, and after
a hasty breakfast we hastened back to the jungle.
</p>

<p>
"We had not entered far, when, O Dios! my friends,
the sight that met our gaze seemed to turn our hearts
to ice.  I shall never, never forget it.
</p>

<p>
"Antoine lay on his back; his face and hands were
purple and swollen; on his brow were two vivid spots
of vermilion; while his open glassy eyes were staring
unmeaningly heavenwards through the trees.
</p>

<p>
"Dead?  Yes, my friend was dead, and coiled around
his neck was a large and fearful snake!"
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
As Miguel finished his little story, Creggan gazed
upwards at the overhanging boughs and the ever-present
snakes.  But his host hastened to reassure him.
</p>

<p>
"Do not fear," he cried, "do not dread.  Snakes are
never vicious.  They are good and kindly creatures,
and at no time will they strike unless attacked, or in
defence of their homes and their progeny."
</p>

<p>
I&mdash;the author&mdash;have had in my time a larger
experience of snakes than I ever at any time desired,
and I can quite believe the story that Miguel told his
guests that day.  Nevertheless, Creggan was never
very sorry when the boat was once more out in the
open stream.
</p>

<p>
The bird and insect life in these lonely dreamy
woods it would be impossible for me to describe.
Suffice it to say, that they were beautiful beyond
compare.  And yet the birds&mdash;that looked like flying
flowers&mdash;had but little song.  Their beauty of colour
is granted them by God that they may resemble the
orchids, and so deceive their reptile foes.  If they
sang much their presence would be revealed.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><br />
DOLCE FAR NIENTE.
</h3>

<p>
Few authors bother themselves, or their friends
either, with maps.  But I am an exception.
Wherever my bark may be, in whatever part of the
globe, on whatever sea, I like to know my bearings
and view my position on the chart.  It is the same if
I journey inland.
</p>

<p>
Then, when writing my tales, I like my boy and
girl readers to be with me, and each of them to keep
his or her weather eye lifting, as I do mine.  Indeed,
as to my latitude and longitude in any portion of this
small world, I am as particular and as "pernicketty"
as any old maid is over her cat, or her cup of brown
tea.
</p>

<p>
So&mdash;if thou lovest me, lad or lass,&mdash;just take your
atlas and turn to the northern parts of South America,
and you shall speedily find Venezuela, and the great
Orinoco river also.  Cast your eyes inland, along this
mighty stream, and you will strike Ciudad Bolivar
(Angostura) on the south bank and Soledad on the
other.
</p>

<p>
It was for Soledad that Miguel made tracks first,
and here he and his guests went on shore and dined
at the poseda or hotel.  It was a brisk time here at
this business season.  For to Soledad come now many
a well-laden wain, and many a string of hardy, loaded
mules, bringing with them the produce of the northern
interior to ship over across stream for Ciudad Bolivar
itself.
</p>

<p>
Tobacco, cereals, horns, hoofs, and hides, with cotton,
corn, and rice, great cheeses, poor ill-used pigs, and
quacking ducks with fowls in bundles and baskets.
</p>

<p>
Our heroes were lucky to arrive at such a time,
and the landlady, though busy, set aside her best
rooms and cooked her best dishes to please the "boy"
Miguel, as she fondly called him.  The boy had
brought his guitar with him, and rejoiced the hearts
of many lads and lasses from up country, who had
come down with their fathers' wains to buy their
dresses and bonnie things, and so go back again happy
to the solitude of upland and forest.
</p>

<p>
Heigho!  I fear Miguel was a sad flirt.  He wasn't
going to play the guitar all the evening, I can assure
you.  No, he must needs hand the instrument to a
friend, while he mingled in the glad, the mad, the
merry fandango.  Well, those beautifully graceful
girl dancers, with their innocent sweetness of face
and dark languishing eyes, were enough to make a
less susceptive young fellow than Miguel flirt.  I
cannot say whether Creggan flirted or not&mdash;I shouldn't
like to say he didn't, but I know he danced, though it
was hot work.
</p>

<p>
Poor Duckling!  He was sitting half-hidden in a
bank of flowers that adorned one end of the hall.
</p>

<p>
"I'm too ugly," he told Creggan, "to get a partner.
I'll be a wall-flower for one night."
</p>

<p>
But&mdash;think of it&mdash;a sweetly pretty girl, after waltzing
past through several dances, eyed him many times
and oft.  I'm sure from what followed that she pitied
the poor sailor-boy in his sad loneliness.  For presently,
fanning herself prettily, she sat near to him.
</p>

<p>
She peeped shyly over the top of her fan a few
times, then summoned courage to say:
</p>

<p>
"You no can dance&mdash;valse?"
</p>

<p>
He smiled drolly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, dear, I can dance well.  But&mdash;but&mdash;I think
I am too ugly to find a partner."
</p>

<p>
"No, señor; no, no.  A good heart is yours.  I see
it in your eye.  Come, dance with me."
</p>

<p>
And she waltzed with him almost continually till the
poseda closed.
</p>

<p>
Kind-hearted was she not?
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Well, after a few days spent here the yacht was
taken over to Ciudad Bolivar, in the neighbourhood
of which was Miguel's house.  Here dwelt this rich
roving lad's mother, and he was the only son.  The
father had been a man who for many years held very
high rank in the country, but the excitement of
business and politics killed him at last.
</p>

<p>
I wish I had time and space to linger over the happy
life those young sailors spent for over a fortnight at
Miguel's mansion.  His little sister&mdash;strange to say,
she was blue-eyed&mdash;took quite a fancy to the Ugly
Duckling.  It might have been a case of Beauty and
the Beast!  Some ill-natured beings would not have
hesitated to say so, but Natina saw only the boy's
mind, and his kindly ways and manners.
</p>

<p>
She was only twelve.  But in her innocence and
naïveté she told him once that if he returned in a few
years she would love him still more, and that then
the <i>padre</i> should join their hands, and they would
and should live happy ever after.
</p>

<p>
Creggan had never seen the Duckling blush before,
but he did so now.  Still, he held out his brown sailor
hand and clasped Natina's wee white one:
</p>

<p>
"I'll come back, Natina, and marry you.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" thought true-hearted Duckie, "shall I ever
get here again?  Do sailors e'er return?"
</p>

<p>
However, he ratified the agreement in the most
natural way possible, and this precocious little lady
henceforward considered herself of no small account,
being engaged, you know.
</p>

<p>
Duckie, as his mess-mates often called him, mostly
for fun but partly for fondness, measured her finger
and promised to send her a ring.  I may as well add
here that he did, and that the correspondence kept up
between them was, on her part anyhow, of a somewhat
gushing description.
</p>

<p>
The temptation to remain longer at this beautiful
house, with its terraced lawns, its tropical gardens, in
which were fountains through the spray of which
rare and beautiful birds dashed backwards and
forwards all day long, and with the grand old forest
stretching away behind to the far-off Llanos, was very
great indeed, but time pressed, and there was yet very
much to be seen in this land of delight.  As to the
parting between Natina and Duckie, I must tell you
that Natina cried a good deal in a quiet way, wiping
her eyes with her bonnie black hair, and that, woman-like,
one of the last things she said was:
</p>

<p>
"Señor Duckie will not forget his Natina's little ring?"
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Ships from all nations call at Ciudad Bolivar,
although the population cannot be over seventy thousand,
judging from memory.  Then, though the streets are
narrow in the business parts, Ciudad Bolivar looks
charming as seen on a bright moonlight night&mdash;as seen
from the river, I mean.  The stream here makes an
inward bend, forming a kind of bay, and is escarped
by bold rocks, on which wave a few trees.  Then the
houses and mansions rise up and up the hill in rows
or crescents, till they reach the top, where stands the
lofty cathedral.
</p>

<p>
Creggan and his friend brought from Ciudad Bolivar
many strange curios, and at the first chance that
offered he sent these home to his mother, and many
to Matty, for sailors when far away at sea never
forget the dear ones at home.
</p>

<p>
After dropping down to the mouth of the river
Orinoco, young Señor Miguel stood out to sea some
distance to be clear of shoals.  Then the wind being
fair, though light, fires were banked on the little
yacht, and slowly along the coast northwards they
held a course.
</p>

<p>
All around here the sea is very lovely indeed&mdash;beyond
compare.
</p>

<p>
When at Miguel's mansion our heroes had been
startled by a shock of earthquake, accompanied by
terrible thunder and lightning, more vivid than they
had ever seen before.  Miguel made light of it next
day.  He said it was only a baby-quake, and couldn't
have rocked a cradle or basinette.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, it seemed to have brought fine weather,
and now the sky above and the sea below were both
an azure blue, the wavelets sparkling like diamond
dust, and now and then breaking into tiny caps of
snow-white spray, as the gentle wind toyed with and
fanned them.
</p>

<p>
Skip-jacks now and then darted from wave to
wave; blue-black flying-fish, too, flew high into the
sunshine, apparently singing <i>I would I were a bird</i>.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes these got on board at night, leaping high
towards the lanterns.  When Creggan saw them
there, he picked them up and threw them safely back
into the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Why should we," he said, "who have so many of
the good things of this world, cruelly take the lives of
those gems of the ocean wave?"
</p>

<p>
Shoals of porpoises were common enough, and
occasionally a sea-cow with splendid eyes would raise
her beautiful sleek, dark head above the water, and
gaze long and curiously at the white-sailed passing
yacht.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes Miguel laid to his vessel and lowered a
boat, that he and his guests might enjoy a few hours'
fishing.  And it was fishing, too.  The fish seemed as
keen to be caught as they were in Duntulm Bay when
Creggan, our hero, was a little boy, and this brought
back to him sunny memories of days never to be
forgotten, so that he often closed his eyes in the bright
sunshine that he might think once more of the past,
and long to be back again in Skye, the Island of
Wings.
</p>

<p>
A week after this we find our heroes in the yacht
anchored in the Caño Colorado&mdash;Caño meaning a
creek; but in this case, at all events, it really is
no creek, but the long quiet mouth of El rio del
Guarapiche, a river that, rising afar among the wild
hills and forests of the west and north, sweeps briskly
on for many a league, forming here and there a
cataract, and here and there a broad brown pool, where
fishes love to bask in the sweet sunshine or leap gladly
up to catch the passing flies.
</p>

<p>
It is all youth and sunshine and joy with the river
at first.  Beautiful wild flowers nod over its banks
and use it as a mirror, bright-winged birds dip in it as
they go skimming through the air, and cloudlands of
trees bend down to kiss the gurgling stream.  But
after many more miles, it goes roaring through dark
wild cañons, and is overhung by frowning rocks which
narrow and deepen it.  The river passes through
jungle also, where nightly the wild beasts fight and
roar.  Then, getting broader now&mdash;its happy youth
all gone,&mdash;less transparent old age seems to gather
over its once glad waters, till, weary at last, it glides
calmly, softly, into the great Atlantic Ocean.
</p>

<p>
Miguel landed at the Caño.  The young fellow
appeared to have friends everywhere, and to be
everywhere as welcome as early primroses.
</p>

<p>
The owner of a property that lay up a creeklet, and
had thereon a pretty wooden bungalow, was most
happy to see Miguel and his friends.  Of course they
must stay to dinner, and that meal was one that
Creggan could not despise.  Delightful curry, most
delicious fish, plantains, sweet potatoes, and the rarest
of fruit.
</p>

<p>
And so with talk and song the evening passed away.
Then down the creek in the starlight they dropped,
and just about
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The wee short 'oor ayont the twal"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
everybody was fast asleep&mdash;except the sentry&mdash;on
board the yacht.
</p>

<p>
On next day towards Maturin.
</p>

<p>
In no hurry, however.  'Twas best to lounge and
dawdle thus, enjoying the <i>dolce far niente</i> by the
river's green wooded banks, or out amid-stream in the
sparkling sunshine.
</p>

<p>
On shore many times and oft, however, to enjoy the
scenery.  Once a huge and insolent cayman attempted
to seize a boatman where he sat.  They were just then
nearing the yacht.  Almost instantly after the crack
of a heavy rifle in the bows of the <i>Queen</i> sounded the
death-knell of that terrible cayman.  Even before the
sound had ceased to reverberate from rock to rock, he
was lashing the water with his tail like some fabled
monster of a bygone age, and dyeing the water with
his blood.
</p>

<p>
Once they landed on the north bank of the river,
and after dragging the light boat a long way through
a rough country, they launched her on a lovely lake
of cerulean blue, that, extending far on every side,
looked like some vast inland sea.
</p>

<p>
Miguel had brought along to-day an extra good
luncheon.  The water teemed with fish, so sport was
excellent.  They landed in a little cove,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O'erhung with wild woods, thickening green",<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and there in cool umbrageous shade they dined.  Then
romantic Miguel, who never went anywhere without
his sweet-and-sad guitar, played and sang.
</p>

<p>
They returned not until the moon was shining high
and clear over the mirrored lake.  Some hands from
the yacht met them in the landing-cove, and the boat
was again dragged riverwards.
</p>

<p>
Not without adventure, however.
</p>

<p>
Creggan always took with him from his ship a
Highland plaid, to be worn at night if belated.  He
was wrapped in that&mdash;happily for him&mdash;on this
particular evening.
</p>

<p>
The boat was still being dragged along a terribly
rough cattle-track, and Creggan was a little way
behind.  Suddenly from out the jungle came a roar that
seemed to shake the earth, and next moment a huge
dark beast sprang high in the moonlit air, and our
hero was thrown violently to the ground.
</p>

<p>
The American lion, his yellow eyes glaring, his red
mouth spitting spume, tore at the Highland plaid.
But the beast's last hour had come, for with an
activity but little less than his own, Miguel attacked
him.  It was a clear-shining dagger that shone aloft.
It descended with a dull thud, and was lifted again
wet with red blood.  In less than ten seconds the wild
beast was despatched.
</p>

<p>
His skin was taken as a trophy by the men, and
presented, after being cured, to Creggan himself.  That
skin is now lying as a rug in the drawing-room of
Creggan's mother's house at Torquay.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Half-way up the river Guarapiche lies the town or
city of Maturin.  Spanish, of course, with quaintly-tiled
or thatched houses, laid out in terraces, streets,
and squares.
</p>

<p>
The people are peaceable enough, though sometimes
quarrels ensue in gambling or drinking dens, knives
are drawn, and red blood spurts all over glasses,
decanters, and counter.
</p>

<p>
There are many Europeans here, and, I think, they
stand by Scotch or Italian.  The latter may occasionally
draw a stiletto, but Sandie doesn't.  Sandie
usually owns a fist as hard and big as the butt-end of
an elephant rifle, and if a row begins, he finds that fist
wondrous handy.
</p>

<p>
I believe that Miguel never thought anything about
the cruelty of cock-fighting and bull-baiting; and at
his invitation our young heroes went to see both.
They were disgusted with the former, and even more
so with the latter.  The poor horses are often gored
even to death, and on that night our Creggan and
his friends saw one unhappy animal rushing wildly
around the arena with&mdash;will it be believed?&mdash;a portion
of his entrails gushing from his side.  The only
incident of this one-sided bull-fight which the Ugly
Duckling really enjoyed, was when a bull picked a
fallen matador airily up by the trews&mdash;the fellow was
on his face&mdash;and flung him over into the crowd.
</p>

<p>
The twisting of the tails of the bulls is very cruel
and shocking.  The matadors want Britishers to
believe that they throw the bull over by sheer strength
of arm.  Nothing of the sort.  The nobler animal
throws himself over to avoid the excruciating agony
of the twist.
</p>

<p>
These matadors are, as far as I could ever judge,
cowardly fellows, as all cruel men are.  I asked one
once to have a boxing round or two with me, for
love.  He excused himself prettily in Spanish, and
I think he did well, because there was no hospital
anywhere near to carry him to after the engagement.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Well, the time was getting on, flying fast indeed,
but to return without seeing the strange, wild, and
dreary scenery of the Llanos would have been out of
the question.
</p>

<p>
The yacht was left in charge of its somewhat ragged
crew, and the three friends with servants and plenty
of arms for sport&mdash;well provisioned too&mdash;started at
last, and after a long, stiff climb found themselves, full
three hundred feet above the sea-level, on a wide and
open plain.
</p>

<p>
It extended&mdash;oh, such a distance far away to the
horizon!  The sea itself seemed less extensive than
these
</p>

<p class="poem">

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><br />
ON THE LONESOME LLANOS.
</h3>

<p>
The vast and lonesome uplands, called Llanos, on
which our heroes now found themselves, are the
pampas of the far southern districts of South America.
</p>

<p>
There is a weirdness about them, especially in the
silence of the night, that strikes one with awe.  But
sometimes, indeed, day is more silent than night, for
then the stillness is unbroken by howl of wild beasts
or scream of birds of prey.  So quiet is it then on
some portions of the Llanos, that you can hear the
sound of the human voice in ordinary conversation
full two hundred yards away, while if you wander
long here, so great is the strain on one's nerves that
the slightest sound will make one start&mdash;a tiny snake
rustling among the grass, a breaking reed, or lizard
nibbling at a stalk of couch.
</p>

<p>
Humboldt, the great traveller, is not, I fear, much
read nowadays, but he speaks about these solitary
regions as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Here in the Llanos, all around us, the plains seemed
to rise to heaven; and this vast and silent desert
appeared to our eyes like a sea that is covered with
sea-weed, or the algae of the deep ocean.  According
to the inequality of the vapour floating on the
atmosphere, and the alternate temperature of the breezes
contending against each other, was the appearance of
the horizon; in some places clearly and sharply defined,
in others wavy, crooked, and, as it were, striped.
</p>

<p>
"The earth there seemed to mingle with heaven.
Through the dry mist we sometimes perceived palm-trees
in the distance.  Stripped of their leaves and
green feathery summits, these stems, rising out of the
low-lying fog, resembled the masts of ships, which one
descries on the horizon at sea."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Miguel's little party was accompanied by donkeys;
some of these had panniers, on which the luggage or
baggage was carried, as well as the general commissariat.
But while two of Miguel's sailors trotted on
foot, he himself with Creggan and his friends bestrode
strong and agile donkeys.
</p>

<p>
As guides, they had two hardy Llaneros or plainsmen.
These fellows are wilder far than your Mexican
cow-boy,&mdash;who, by the way, is just as often as not
a braggart and a coward.  But your true Llanero,
with his brown skin, his tattered clothes and cow-hide
boots, and the ever-ready lasso across his chest, a
knife or pistol in his belt, is as daring as a puma or
panther itself.  He knows no fear, and takes no hurt
wherever he sleeps, or however hard his toil and poor
his fare.
</p>

<p>
No need for a traveller to fear these men.  Treat
them fairly and squarely, and they will do their duty,
ay, and fight to grim death for the man they have
undertaken to watch and guide.
</p>

<p>
Our brave youngsters were marching southwards
and west, and would so march for days, until, after
crossing many a creek and cañon, and many a river
that goes roaring, brown and awful, through gorges
among the hills and woods, they should strike the
River Tigre itself.
</p>

<p>
One of the rivers they crossed is wildly beautiful&mdash;the
Mapiriti.  They spent two nights and days near
to its green banks, and in a bonny wooded and bosky
glen.  But they had shooting and fishing also.
</p>

<p>
Night alone was dreary&mdash;and dangerous too.  To
protect the donkeys from the attacks of wild beasts,
they had to cut down branches and throw up a kind
of laager, for after supper was cooked and eaten, and
the fires burning low warned them that it was time to
sleep, the cries and roaring of beasts of prey began,
and the brutes came all too close to camp to be
agreeable.  But the sentries&mdash;two there were&mdash;had orders
to fire if they heard but a bush stirring.  The quick
sharp ring of the rifles generally ensured peace for a
time.
</p>

<p>
Miguel slept on some bundles of grass, with a pillow
of the same material.  Nor wild beasts, snakes, nor
mosquitoes ever seemed to annoy him.
</p>

<p>
But the Ugly Duckling and Creggan had each a
hammock, hung gipsy-fashion from crossed sticks a
few feet above the ground.
</p>

<p>
After Creggan had said his prayers and lain down,
he used to promise himself that he would lie awake
for some time and think of his far-off Highland home.
But he never succeeded in doing so with any degree
of satisfaction.  The fatigue of travel, the pure, fresh,
and bracing air, to say nothing of a good supper, all
tended to induce slumber, and soon indeed was he in
the land of forgetfulness, seldom opening his eyes till
breakfast was steaming and simmering over the fire.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
I must draw in my horns, as the snail said to the
blackbird; for it was not my intention to give an
elaborate account of this great land of Llanos, of broad
bright rivers studded with islands like emerald gems,
of cayman-haunted creeks, of green savannahs, of
waving palms, of deep dark forests surrounding many
a lonesome gloomy leaden lake, and of mountains
towering to the moon.  No; see Venezuela for yourselves,
boys.  If you do, you can say afterwards that
you have lived, should you never visit any other
foreign land save itself.
</p>

<p>
Suffice it to say that, laden with the spoils of the
chase, the <i>Queen</i> one beautiful forenoon brought our
heroes safely back to the mouth of the great river
Orinoco, and that their arrival was a scene of rejoicing.
</p>

<p>
Poor Admiral Jacko was worn and thin, for sadly
had he missed his Ugly Duckling, and now sprang
into his arms with a fond and plaintive cry, and in his
own strange language told him a weary, weary tale.
</p>

<p>
It was delightful to get home again to the ship
after all, and that night, after they had dined with
the captain, Miguel being also a guest, our wanderers
slept more soundly than they had done for many and
many a day.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><br />
PROMOTION.
</h3>

<p>
I may tell my would-be or will-be sailor-boys, that
time flies fast enough when one is serving in a
pleasant and happy ship on a foreign shore.  Just a
little weariness and longing there may be for the
first month or two, then one settles down.
</p>

<p>
You do not cease to think of home, however.  As
regards love of home, absence really makes the heart
grow fonder.  You think of it often and often when
keeping your lonesome middle-watch, as you gaze
upwards at the star-studded sky, or outwards far across
the darkling sea, and you dream of it while rocked in
your hammock or tiny cabin-cot; and somehow these
dreams are nearly always pleasant.  Then again, a dear
delight it is to receive letters from home.  The next
greatest pleasure is in writing them.
</p>

<p>
Writing letters home, as far as the Royal Navy is
concerned, is an occupation one should engage in at all
odd moments.  The letters should be ready to go at
any time, for you never know when a chance may
occur.  A homeward-bound ship may be sighted and
lie to, then aft and forward rings the cry, "Letters
for home!"
</p>

<p>
If the midshipman of the watch or a bo's'n draws
aside the gun-room curtain, and shouts "Any letters
for England, gentlemen?" and you have not got yours
ready, owing to a spirit of procrastination that lately
dominated you,&mdash;well, you will be ready to bite the tip
off your tongue.  You will feel just real mad with
yourself.
</p>

<p>
But so many incidents and adventures, to say
nothing of duty's strict routine, go to make up a
sailor's life, whether young or not, that it is wonderful
how speedily pass the months, ay, and the years too,
until the "Ordered home" arrives.
</p>

<p>
Then indeed is there excitement.  But once the
jib-boom is pointing straight ahead towards our own
beloved land, time no longer flies, it abjures the swift,
darting flight of the swallow and lags along at the
pace of a slug.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Well now, two whole years have passed away since
Creggan and his friend made that memorable though
all too brief tour in Venezuela with the kindly young
landsman Miguel, and it would be difficult indeed
to cram the story of all their ups and downs into even
a dozen chapters.  I have no such intention.  In fact,
though I tell this story from the life, it is impossible
for me to remember all they did or didn't do in that
time.
</p>

<p>
I will just inform you, that at the end of two years
they were once more back again at the mouth of the
great white rolling Orinoco, and, as history repeats
itself, Miguel once more came on board, looking not a
bit changed, and once more Creggan and the Ugly
Duckling went with him up stream to his mother's
beautiful mansion.
</p>

<p>
This time they intended going no farther, but they
were accompanied by dear, kind little Sidney Wickens,
and also by their two staunch friends, Hurricane Bob
and Oscar.
</p>

<p>
Now, I must tell you something.  Sidney was a
genial but quiet young fellow, whose very manner
appeared to invite the confidence of his fellows, and
when, one evening, nobody but he and Duckie sat
together in their little mess-room&mdash;this was shortly
after their first visit to Venezuela,&mdash;the latter had
suddenly begun to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," cried Sidney, "give us a chance to join you,
old man.  A good laugh is invaluable, from a health
point of view."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll tell you, though I wouldn't tell everybody."
</p>

<p>
"No?  Well, let me hear."
</p>

<p>
"Then," said the Duckling, "you wouldn't think
that anyone so awfully ugly as I am would have a
little sweetheart."
</p>

<p>
"My dear fellow," said Sidney soothingly, "I'll tell
you the truth.  As to beauty you are not an Adonis,
but your manner is so good-natured and pleasant and
humorsome and all that, one never thinks about your
features.  Besides, as a rule girls hate pretty faces on
men; that is, sensible girls do."
</p>

<p>
"Well, but my sweetheart is only a child."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me."
</p>

<p>
The Ugly Duckling did, from the beginning of the
story down to the parting and the promised
engagement-ring.
</p>

<p>
Sidney was much interested.
</p>

<p>
Then getting up he said quietly, "I'll be back in a
minute."
</p>

<p>
He drew aside, the curtain and disappeared.  Down
to his big sea-chest in the cockpit he dived, and soon
returned singing low to himself, with his jewel-case
in one hand.  He placed it on the table, and opened
his show of sparkling gems.
</p>

<p>
"Give me that bit of cardboard," he said, "with
the size of Natina's finger in it.  Ah!" he cried jubilantly
a moment after, "this one will just fit.  A trifle
large, but her sweet wee finger will grow to it.  See
how it sparkles!  Isn't it just too awfully lovely for
anything?"
</p>

<p>
"But, dear Wickens, I&mdash;I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Come now, none of that.  If you won't have it,
why, I'll keep it and give it to the pretty Natina
myself, and so cut you out."
</p>

<p>
"I shall have it," cried his companion laughing as
he stretched out his hand, "But, how can I thank you?"
</p>

<p>
"By not saying a word.  If you thank me I'll shy
a bit of biscuit at you.  So there!"
</p>

<p>
Well, on this second visit the Ugly Duckling would
not go up stream without Sidney, and they all spent
a most happy week.
</p>

<p>
Of course Natina was greatly delighted with the
ring, and just as pretty and affectionate as ever, only
she divided her affections most impartially between
the dogs and the Duckling.
</p>

<p>
Miguel gave a party and a dance or play every night.
His guests stopped at the mansion, and when good-byes
were said at last they were very sincere indeed,
and, as far as innocent little Natty was concerned,
accompanied by tears.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The <i>Osprey</i> had got her anchor up, and started now
on a very long cruise indeed&mdash;all the way to New
Zealand and Australia.
</p>

<p>
I always think the study of a really good map of
the world is quite a delight.  It gives one such a
thorough insight as to the bearings of his own little
land, to the seas and vast continents in other parts of
the globe.  Geography, I believe, should always be
taught and learned in the easiest and most pleasant
way possible.
</p>

<p>
Now, I suppose that if I were to tell you that Cape
Horn was the southernmost point of land in South
America, and that the ship was now going to coast
down and round this stormy cape, you would naturally
think her course would lie south all the way.
</p>

<p>
Not at all.  Oblige me by looking at your map.
</p>

<p>
And now let us sail along in the jolly old frigate.
</p>

<p>
We leave, then, the mouth of the mighty Orinoco,
and instead of steering south it is pretty nearly all
easting until we reach Trinidad, the most southerly of
all the West India islands, then our course is about
south-east and by east till we cross the burning
equator and round Cape St. Roque, then about south
till we look in at Rio Janeiro.
</p>

<p>
Rio Janeiro stands next to Edinburgh as the most
romantic in situation and surroundings in the world.
The city itself perhaps looks best at a distance&mdash;well,
Scot though I be, I must confess that there are some
parts of Old Edinburgh itself that at best will hardly
bear close inspection.  Rio simply means a river, and
Rio Janeiro is the city of romance.
</p>

<p>
We take a course now with a bit of westerly in it,
and in time reach another Rio&mdash;the Rio de la Plata.
Yonder on our starboard beam lies the great and
painfully-neglected Argentine Republic.
</p>

<p>
Coasting still to the south we skirt the shores of
Patagonia.
</p>

<p>
Somehow we associate everything big and large
with this long stretch of wild country.  Land of
giants, land of the llama and swiftly-bounding
guanaco.  Land of the lasso, too, and stalwart men on
fleet horses that can use it.  Not a bad lot of fellows
at all, if you take them the right way.
</p>

<p>
But here we are at the entrance to the Straits of
Magellan.  No, we are not going through this voyage.
We pass between the coast and the lonely Falkland
Islands.  These islands of the far south are somewhat
akin in climate to our Orkneys, healthy and bracing,
though the country is subject to terrible storms.  It
has hills and dells and glens, with many a dark tarn
and rippling stream, crowded with fish that are by no
means shy.  The islands number about eighty in all.
The summer is very pleasant.  If you and I go there
to spend a few months, reader, we'll have excellent
sport, and no letters or morning papers to worry over.
The Falklands are almost treeless, but that does not
signify much so long as one is happy and can eat
a good breakfast.
</p>

<p>
Well, here is Staten Island.  Rather different is
this Argentine isle from the Staten of New York.
</p>

<p>
Ugh! how bitterly the north-western winds are
howling around its rocks.  And see, yonder&mdash;summer
though it be&mdash;its dark gloomy cliffs, home of the
penguin and many a strange bird besides, are capped
with snow; so, too, are its mountains.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally now a sea-elephant looks up to stare
at us, and now and then a shoal of the ubiquitous
porpoises go dancing and cooing past, or a solitary
whale ploughs across our hawse but deigns not even
to look at us.  He or she is intent only on her own
business.  Perhaps she has a calf alongside her
sucking like an overgrown puppy&mdash;great, sweet
innocent,&mdash;and she is taking it north to warmer water.
</p>

<p>
My conscience!&mdash;as they say in the north of bonnie
Scotland,&mdash;how ships that can only sail have to rough
it while rounding the Cape!  Snow and fog, icebergs,
and sometimes howling winds from the west-north-west!
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And now there came both mist and snow,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it grew wondrous cold;<br />
  And ice, mast-high, came floating by,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As green as emerald."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Yes, green enough as to its sides sometimes, but all
clad in deep, deep snow above.
</p>

<p>
And we now walk the icy decks carefully, blowing
occasionally on our half-frozen though mitted fingers.
The ear-lappets of our sou'-westers are pulled down,
our faces being either blue or white according to the
strength of the circulation.
</p>

<p>
Small pieces of ice rattle along our quarters and
bump us, but we care not for that; we do but pray
that in the darkness of night we may not foul the
fore-foot of some fearful berg.  Should we do so, backward
our barque would reel and stagger, to sink all too
soon in the deepest, blackest sea, that rolls anywhere
around this terrestrial ball.
</p>

<p>
To our starboard, though we cannot see it, lies the
terrible island of Tierra del Fuego, literally the Land
of Fire.  Land of the canoe islanders, the most
implacable savages to be met with anywhere.  Who is
going to take his life in his hand and spend a year in
exploring this wild country?  Will you come with
me, boy-readers?  Why, we should make a name to
ourselves, if not fortunes.  We should come back, if
the savages didn't roast and eat us, with a book.  We
should add much to the geography and the anthropology
of the world, and discover&mdash;coals.
</p>

<p>
But our ship is clear away from the black stormy
sea at last, and clear of the ice.
</p>

<p>
So we sail merrily on across a wide and trackless
ocean on a beam wind for weeks and weeks, till,
hurrah! we are past Bounty Island and reach bonnie
Dunedin itself.  And here let me tell you, that if there
be a single drop of Scottish blood in your veins, you
are sure of a Highland welcome.
</p>

<p>
The cruise described in this chapter is just as near
to the life as I can make it, and pretty much what
our bold crew of the <i>Osprey</i> found it.  And the
paddle-frigate soon after this came across the new flag-ship
for the Australian station.  Captain Leeward himself
boarded her, accompanied by a lieutenant, leaving the
other officers to wait impatiently for his return.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder," said the Ugly Duckling to Dr. Grant,
"if we shall be ordered home."
</p>

<p>
"Not the ghost of a chance of that, mother's brave
and beautiful boy," replied Grant; "but we'll have
letters, and lots of further despatches sending us off
wild-goose chasing all over the world."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I like it," said Creggan.
</p>

<p>
"So do I," said Sidney Wickens.
</p>

<p>
Creggan was twenty-one now, and a handsome
sailor he looked in his jacket of blue, with his budding
moustache of darkest down, his bright face, and happy
smile that nothing could banish.
</p>

<p>
When Captain Leeward returned, they soon found
that Grant was right in his surmise.  There was no
"Ordered home", but plenty of despatches for many
parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
There were letters from home.  It is needless to say
that these were hailed with delight.
</p>

<p>
But there was something else as well, namely, an
order addressed to sub-lieutenants Creggan Ogg
M'Vayne and Sidney Wickens to repair forthwith
on board the flag-ship and pay their respects to the
admiral.
</p>

<p>
"Something good, I'll be bound!" said Grant.  "Ah,
you're lucky lads!  The Lords Commissioners seldom
think of us poor slaving surgeons.  Heigho!"
</p>

<p>
The admiral received them on his quarter-deck with
great affability.  Then he asked them in to his own
quarters and bade them be seated.
</p>

<p>
"I have good news for you both," he said, "and, not
to go about the bush, you are both promoted to be
lieutenants.
</p>

<p>
"And," he added, "you can go home in the <i>D&mdash;&mdash;</i>,
which will sail from Port Phillip a month hence, and
take up your commissions."
</p>

<p>
Both the young fellows smiled joyously and thanked
him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir," said Creggan, "is it absolutely necessary
that I should go home?  Could you not grant me
leave to remain in the dear old <i>Osprey</i>, mess in the
gun-room, and see all that is to be seen until the
paddler is ordered home?"
</p>

<p>
The admiral laughed right heartily.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, "it is the drollest application ever
I heard.  What about you, Mr. Wickens?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh please, admiral, I'll go home."
</p>

<p>
"Then I grant you leave to stay, Mr. M'Vayne.  But
I have still better news to give you.
</p>

<p>
"Commander Flint," he added with that pleasant
smile of his, "under whom you served, and whose life
you saved in a particularly gallant way, has been
moving heaven and earth, and Whitehall as well, to
obtain for you the Victoria Cross for conspicuous
bravery in presence of the foe.  And I think I can
assure you he will be successful, so you may look
forward, Mr. M'Vayne, to having that grand decoration
conferred on you by the hands of our dear Queen
herself."
</p>

<p>
Creggan felt himself growing red and white by
turns.  He could only blurt out a few words which I
dare say were very stupid.  But the admiral laid a
kindly hand on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Go on board your own ship now, Lieutenant
M'Vayne, and say no more.  But you must both come
and dine with me to-night.  Till then, adieu."
</p>

<p>
Every man-Jack felt sad when Sidney Wickens
sailed for home.  He had endeared himself to all.
And his mess-mates never saw him more.  He was
buried, I think, at sea, in the bosom of the blue
Levant.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><br />
ADVENTURE IN A PAPUAN LAKE-VILLAGE.
</h3>

<p>
And now, if you will take one further wee glance
at that prettily-coloured map of yours, you shall
find Australia easily enough.  But look at its northern
shores, and you will be able to see a great gap there
called the Gulf of Carpentaria, and on its eastern
shore and point is Cape York, separated from the
large island called New Guinea by the Straits of
Torres.  There!  I am teaching you geography in a
more pleasant way than you have it dished up at
school.
</p>

<p>
Well, this vast island has never been really or
thoroughly explored, for two reasons principally,
because the inhabitants&mdash;a mixture of Papuans and
aboriginal Australians&mdash;are never quite civil to white
men, and because the climate is moist among the
forests or tropical verdure that lies low along the
shores, and fever, therefore, always ready to make
a victim of the adventurer.  But inland, if one gets
safely through the regions of damp and forest fogs,
will be found many a beautiful hill and dell, quite a
mountain-land, exceeding in romantic grandeur some
parts of Scotland itself.
</p>

<p>
It was in 1889 that brave Sir W. M'Gregor explored
the island&mdash;to some considerable extent.  New Guinea,
he found, is almost everywhere clothed with rich and
highly diversified flora.  His party, after passing
successively through the dominions of tropical plants,
such as the cocoa-nut, sago, banana, mango, taro, and
sugar-cane, and of such temperate or sub-tropical
growth as the cedar, oak, fig, acacia, pine, and
tree-fern, were gladdened in the higher slopes by the sight
of the wild strawberry, forget-me-not, daisy, buttercup,
and other familiar British plants; while towards
the summit these were succeeded by a true Alpine
flora, in which Himalayan, Bohean, New Zealand, and
sub-Antarctic forms were all numerously represented.
</p>

<p>
And this was the strange wild island to which the
<i>Osprey</i> was now to steer.  On what business bent
I never could say for certain.  But I rather think it
was to spy out the land; our own half that is, for we
kindly and considerately permit the Germans and
Dutch to do what they like with the other half.
Neither make good colonists; the Dutch are too slow,
the Germans too frightened at natives.
</p>

<p>
These savages are either quite peaceable and
industrious, or wild and fierce, with a strong liking for
"man-meat" or "long-pig".  These terrible wretches
like pork, but will lick the backs of their black hands,
and declare to you, that there is nothing in the world
to beat roast missionary, as a <i>piece de resistance</i>, or
cold side-dish.  The fiercest tribes live among the
mountains.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The <i>Osprey</i>, with fine weather nearly all the way,
reached Cape York, lying in for a few days at the
port of Albany.
</p>

<p>
Then she stood right away north to Port Moresby,
where is a British government-station&mdash;not of great
consequence, it must be admitted.  Here the anchor
was let go, and boats came off from shore.  Our people
shook brown, sun-tanned hands with their countrymen,
and a hearty welcome was accorded to all.
</p>

<p>
The blue-jackets were permitted to land in relays,
on pain, however, of punishment if they interfered in
any way with the Papuan natives.  For really Jack's
ways with niggers&mdash;as he calls all black or even
brown people&mdash;are sometimes rather free and easy, to
say the least of it.
</p>

<p>
Now, Captain Leeward was fully alive to the quiet
pluck and bravery that Creggan and his friend the
Ugly Duckling had ever exhibited in the presence of
danger, and would have trusted them to go anywhere
and do anything.  And they were always so willing
and cheerful, that it was a pleasure to the captain to
let them go exploring whenever so minded.  He knew
they would not be foolishly rash.
</p>

<p>
Well, when Creggan and his friend landed, they
determined to have a good look around, and even to
make a dive into the splendid tropical forest behind
the settlement.
</p>

<p>
They took Goodwin the mate with them for a bodyguard,
with one sailor, bold Jack Hing&mdash;poor fellow,
he was afterwards drowned on the China station.
For a handful of coppers they obtained the guidance
of a "boy".  This "boy", however, was fully forty
years of age, judging from appearance.  But he
seemed kindly disposed, showed a splendid set of
teeth when he smiled, and looked generally jolly.
</p>

<p>
Both Hurricane Bob and Oscar went on this picnic,
and how they did scamper around and enjoy themselves,
to be sure!  But I must add that they sadly
frightened the black ladies and children, as the Ugly
Duckling grandly called them.  They ran shrieking
away as soon as Bob's voice sounded along the beach,
and hid themselves in the cool darkness of their
leaf-and-bamboo huts.
</p>

<p>
This tribe seemed very industrious.  They were
allowed but little rum.  It is that which turns the
ordinary savage into a wild raving maniac, and causes
him to run "amok" with knife, or spear, or nulla,
slaying every man, woman, or child he meets till he
himself is slain.
</p>

<p>
The people here made pretty baskets, and worked
in clay also, even young children assisting.  Then
Creggan found near to the shore many cultivated
fields surrounded by wattling and hedges.  In these
grew paddy, sweet potatoes, and the lordly yam.
</p>

<p>
The men, too, went out fishing.  There are two
species of boats here.  One I might describe as a kind
of Papuan gondola of large dimensions.  About fifteen
tons or over.  These boats are low in the centre, but
sweep upwards at the stern and bows, rather prettily
too.  Then there is the ordinary dug-out, which is
simply a tree-trunk formed into boat-shape by axe
and adze, the inside finished off with fire to harden
it, after which thwarts are nailed, or rather pegged
across.  But your dug-out would turn turtle if not
fitted on each side with long out-riggers.  This
dug-out is common also in most parts of savage Africa.
</p>

<p>
Creggan's guide on this occasion was a very good
specimen of his tribe.  When you see one grown man
you know what the rest are like.  The guide, then, was
as black as&mdash;as&mdash;I was going to say soot, but that is
really a black that has a rusty tinge in it.  As black,
then, as the inside of an empty tar-barrel with the
bung in.
</p>

<p>
Well, Ephraim&mdash;as Creggan called him, though why
I am sure I could not tell you&mdash;had, to begin with,
such a mop of frizzly hair, that had you turned him
upside down it might have been used to sweep the
decks with.  This hair was black, but intermixed with
silvery threads.  Both brows and nose were rather
prominent.  His nostrils were wide, and moved about
with every word he said.  He was most spirited too,
emphasizing every voluble sentence with strange
gestures and shrugging of shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Most of the men seen had their hair and beards
stained with reddish clay, but not so Ephraim.  He
was proud of his gray hairs.  His mouth was quite the
same as the real African nigger; wide enough to have
engulfed an ordinary-sized turnip, and the lips were
very bulgy and thick.  Armlets, bangles, and ear-rings
of brass are common to both sexes.
</p>

<p>
Little children went about entirely naked.  Ephraim's
whole suit of wearing apparel could not have cost much
anywhere.  He had a bit of manilla rope round the
waist, to which his sheathed knife was fixed, and to
which also was attached what looked like a dirty
towel.  This was tied to the rope in front, passed
between the limbs, and was tied to the rope again at
the back.  But there was nothing repulsive about this
man.  He looked bold, erect, and honest; nor would
his glance have quailed before the Queen.
</p>

<p>
His wife, for he had one, was positively prepossessing;
and I am really glad to testify to this, for the
pictures of Papuans placed before our school-boys are
terrible caricatures.
</p>

<p>
Ephraim's wife was certainly undressed from the
waist upwards, with the exception of bangles and a
necklace of teeth, and pretty shells, pink and
snow-white.  From the waist to the knees she wore a skirt
of grass cloth, surmounted by a shorter one of fringed
cocoa-nut fibre.  She smiled affably and innocently
when Creggan spoke to her, showing teeth as white as
those of a six-months-old Newfoundland dog, and she
glanced upwards at the handsome lieutenant with eyes
that were certainly beautiful.
</p>

<p>
There was something truly good in Treekee's heart,
I'm sure, for seeing the dogs pant, she brought a
calabash of water, and lying down beside them in the
shade of a tree-fern, made them drink from the half
of a cocoanut-shell.
</p>

<p>
Honest Bob licked Treekee's black face to show his
gratitude.
</p>

<p>
That day our heroes had a long tour through the
forest with Ephraim and his wife.  They had come
armed, but did not find much to shoot, so they
contented themselves by making a collection of splendid
butterflies and beautifully-coloured beetles.
</p>

<p>
Ephraim got them back by three o'clock.  He then
proposed that they should be rowed over in dug-outs
to visit a lake-village.  Their own boat was hauled up
safely under the banana-trees.  So away they went.
</p>

<p>
It was certainly the strangest little town that Creggan
had ever visited.  It consisted of about sixty huts
in all, each of which was elevated above the water on
strong poles or scaffolding, fully nine feet above the
surface.
</p>

<p>
The walls of these huts were of bamboo, that is, the
framework.  Over this slabs of pith were placed.  The
roofs were of grass and plantain leaves, and each was
supplied with a shutter, generally open all day to
admit light and air, and get rid of smoke.  Into one
of the largest of these huts our heroes crawled by a
withy ladder, while Ephraim returned, promising to
be back an hour before sunset.
</p>

<p>
Well, Creggan was quite astonished at the amount
of room inside this lake-dwelling, although the walls
from platform to eaves were only about five feet high.
</p>

<p>
The floor was of pith over bamboo, and spread with
a charmingly-worked grass carpet.  A fire could be
lit, when needed for cooking purposes, on a red-clay
hearth at one end.  But at present it was out, so the
room was delightfully cool.
</p>

<p>
Their welcome was a hearty one, and as Creggan
had brought beads and ribbons and tobacco as gifts,
the owner&mdash;a fine-looking specimen,&mdash;his young wife,
and two toddling children were all delighted.
</p>

<p>
But Creggan, or rather Goodwin, had brought also
a bountiful repast.  There was quite enough for all.
</p>

<p>
The chief&mdash;if chief he was&mdash;nodded significantly to
his wife, muttering something that our young fellows
could not understand.  She immediately arose and put
both children to bed in a corner.  They didn't require
any undressing, for the dear wee black totties, as Ugly
Duckling called them, wore nothing save a string of
kangaroo teeth.
</p>

<p>
Then the good lady brought knives and spears, and
other implements of savage warfare, and laid them down
on the mat on which Creggan and his friends were
squatting.
</p>

<p>
This was an act of good faith, and said plainly
enough:
</p>

<p>
"Lo! you are safe in my hut.  Behold I place all
my weapons at your feet."
</p>

<p>
But this chief could talk fairly good English, and he
spun some terrible yarns, about the fierce men who
dwelt among the wild mountains.  He entreated them
not to venture there, else they would return "plenty
dead, and much bloody".
</p>

<p>
This was not encouraging, so Creggan thought over
a plan he had formed for visiting the hills, and finally
gave it up, for a time at all events.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty bad mountain men.  Plenty white men dey
makee fat, den roast and gobble up.  Brains smashee
out wi' one club.  Oh, mountain men plenty mooch big
fellows!"
</p>

<p>
"But for all that," said Creggan to his friend, "I
should like to go some day."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied the Duckling; "but I wouldn't like
to be fed up and killed and cooked&mdash;eh, would you?"
</p>

<p>
"Roast duckling and green peas," said Creggan
maliciously.  "Come, sing these folks a song, old chap,
and you sha'n't be cooked.  There!"
</p>

<p>
The Duckling did as told, and the chief and his
wife seemed charmed.  Even the children sat up on
one end in the corner, and rolled their white eyes in
ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
So the time passed away very cheerfully indeed.
But lo! just before the hour for the dug-outs to arrive
a squall came on, the water or spray dashed high over
the roof of the hut, and when Creggan peeped out it
was all a-smother as far as he could see.
</p>

<p>
They hoped against hope that the weather would
moderate, but squall succeeded squall, and soon darkness
fell over land and water.  It was evident, therefore,
that our heroes were prisoners for one night.
</p>

<p>
Well, your true sailor always tries to make the best
of every adventure.  They had plenty to eat of their
own, and lighting the fire the kindly Papuan lady
cooked and placed fish before them on palm-leaf
plates.
</p>

<p>
Then they had delicious fruit&mdash;bananas such as you
never see in our land, guavas that tasted like strawberries
smothered in cream, glorious rosy mangoes, and
cocoanut-milk to drink.
</p>

<p>
They were happy.
</p>

<p>
More songs were sung, more stories told, and then,
with the utmost confidence, our sailor-lads laid
themselves back on their mats, using their jackets for
pillows, and were soon sound and fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
Daylight was shimmering in through the crevices of
door and shutter when Creggan awoke.  The room
was hot, so, seeing him wipe the perspiration from his
brow, the chief, after nodding a kindly good-morning,
opened the gable door.
</p>

<p>
The water was deeply blue, not a cloud was to be
seen in the cerulean sky, and the wind was hushed.
Beyond was the beautiful cloudland of forest trees and
waving palms, and away on the horizon the everlasting
hills.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap27"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><br />
A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.
</h3>

<p>
The others were still asleep.
</p>

<p>
"No wake," said the chief.  "No wake, poor
boys.  Plenty soon I catchee breakfast.  Den my vife
she cook.  Ah! man-meat no good.  Arrack no good.
God heself he send de cocoa-nut and de fish.  Missional
man he tell me foh true."
</p>

<p>
Then down squatted this strange black man in his
doorway, with his legs dangling over, outside.  He
had a short rod and line, and really the fish required
but little coaxing, for he soon hauled up seven or eight
big beauties.
</p>

<p>
These were sprinkled with salt and various kinds of
pepper, placed on hot stones over the fire, and covered
with fragrant wet leaves.  They were soon done to a
turn.  So were yams and sweet potatoes.  Then Creggan
asked a blessing, and all declared that they had never
eaten a more delightful breakfast in their lives.
</p>

<p>
By and by a strange kind of chant was heard coming
nearer and nearer to the village, and presently the
plash of paddles.
</p>

<p>
Lo! the dug-outs had arrived.  So, bidding their
kind host and hostess adieu, after filling the children's
hands with sweets, they lowered themselves into the
canoes and were quickly paddled on shore.
</p>

<p>
They reached their own ship that forenoon in safety,
much delighted with all they had seen and heard, and
now, business being transacted, steam was got up, and
the <i>Osprey</i> went heading away for far northern China
seas.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The letters from home which last mail had brought
Creggan were very delightful reading, especially those
from Daddy the hermit, from his mother, and little
Matty Nugent.  Nugent's own letter brought him sad
enough news, however, to the effect that poor M'Ian
the minister had been borne to his long home by his
loving parishioners, and that all that country-side of
Skye was plunged in grief.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. M'Ian and her children, Rory and Maggie, had
gone to reside in Perth for the better education of the
latter.  Maggie, or Sister Maggie, wrote a sad little
letter to Creggan&mdash;it was really blurred with tears,
and grief was en evidence throughout every page of
it.
</p>

<p>
The voyage to Chinese and Japanese waters was
a very long but somewhat uneventful one.  It took
them westward through Torres Straits first, then
across the bright and beautiful Sea of Arafura, all
dotted with little green-fringed islands hung like
emeralds on the horizon.  Next, across the Sea of
Banda, and so away and away past Molucca and
Gilolo, till they skirted the Philippine Isles, Formosa,
and Loo-choo, then they were indeed in Chinese
waters.
</p>

<p>
But no storm or tempest had marred the pleasure
of this almost idyllic voyage, and they reached
Shanghai in safety.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Here they met several man-of-war ships, more than
they expected to, and everybody had a real good time
of it.  Some of these ships of war were sent from
the East India station hurriedly, their object being to
protect British interests in these waters, and north
beyond Corea, in the Sea of Japan.
</p>

<p>
Well, Japan seems, to look at it on a map, only
a little, little island compared to that vast tract of
land called China, that teems with its hundreds of
millions.  True, but Japan is civilized.  Japan has a
splendid army of fire-eating soldiers, and a navy fit
to go anywhere and do anything, while China is still
wrapped in the mists of heathendom, and ruled by
a government as blind as it is ignorant.  Foreigners
are hated by the Chinese.  Hated and hooted wherever
they go.  The country is two thousand years behind
the age, and not even while I write is it yet opened
up to commerce.
</p>

<p>
Well, Captain Leeward learned now for the first
time that war-clouds were banking up in the eastern
horizon, that the war-wind would blow from the east,
and that soon the storm would burst in all its fury
over Corea and the self-conceited Chinese.
</p>

<p>
No one knew the day or the hour when the first
angry shot should go shrieking through the air.
</p>

<p>
It was a season of breathless suspense, like that
which thrills the mariner's heart with its very silence,
before the down-come of an awful hurricane at sea;
when the stillness is a stillness that can be felt, when
the very birds are silent and float listlessly on the
smooth oily billows, or perch on the fins of some
basking shark.
</p>

<p>
But a vessel was now sent round to Bombay,
and here despatches awaited her which she was to
carry back with her to the British fleet in Chinese
waters.
</p>

<p>
We were, it must be remembered, quite neutral
in this great and bloody war, but I think that the
heart of every true-born Scot or Englishman went
out towards the brave Japanese, and followed them
with intense interest throughout all their glorious
career.
</p>

<p>
I have no desire at this part of my story to be dry
and technical.  I am never so.  I am built, I trust, on
the keel of common sense, but I would rather laugh
and be merry any day than talk politics, and would
rather spin a good sailor's yarn than preach.
</p>

<p>
But still it will do the reader no harm to know
somewhat of the provocation, that the brave Japanese
received, before they let slip the dogs of war.  I shall
let the historian speak, however.  The bone of contention
really was the great Peninsula of Corea.
</p>

<p>
"The first complication in Corea," says the historian,
"which threatened the peace of the three countries of
the far east, happened in July, 1882.  Kim-Ok-Kim
and other Coreans had been over to Japan.  Surprised
and pleased at the wonders they had seen, they came
back partisans of progress and enthusiastic supporters
of Japanese influence.  Their ideas were not favourably
received by the ex-regent, or Tai-Wen-Kun, who was
a hater of everything foreign, and he began to intrigue
with the Min, a peaceful faction in Corea.
</p>

<p>
"It was then decided to drive the Japanese out of
the country by violence.  The soldiers were infuriated
by having their rations diminished, and then malicious
reports about the Japanese were spread about the
capital.  A furious mob began to hunt to death all
the defenceless Japanese that could be found.
</p>

<p>
"A Japanese officer, who had been drilling the Corean
troops, and seven others, were murdered in one day,
the Legation was attacked and burned, and the minister
with twenty-eight Japanese had to fight their way
through the streets of Seoul (the capital), and through
the country to the sea, where they embarked in a junk,
and were picked up by the British gun-boat <i>Flying
Fish</i>, which took them to Nagasaki.
</p>

<p>
"The Japanese government at once took measures
to obtain redress for the outrage; troops were got
ready for any emergency, and the minister was sent
back to Seoul with a military force.  The Chinese also
sent troops to Corea.  The Corean government had
then to apologize to Japan, pay a large indemnity, and
give pensions to the widows and relations of the slain.
</p>

<p>
"Moreover, Japanese soldiers were now stationed
permanently at Seoul to protect the Legation."
</p>

<p>
China did not quite like this, and she sent a still
larger detachment of her hen-hearted soldiers; a
soldiery that cannot fight half so well as Newhaven
fishwives, an opium-eating, deteriorated race, which but
to look at makes one think that the end of the world
cannot be far away, or that if these creatures called
the Chinese are really descended from the ape&mdash;with
apologies to the monkey tribe,&mdash;they are speedily
"throwing back", as breeders say, to their ancestry.
</p>

<p>
Well, for two years longer things went smoothly
enough in Corea, though the Min or old fogey party
had all the best places.
</p>

<p>
In December, 1884, a great party was given to
celebrate the opening of the post-office at Seoul.  This
was more than the Chinese could stand, an attack was
made, the party was broken up, and there was a
massacre of ministers.  The old-fashioned Coreans,
dominated by the Chinese, wouldn't have progress at any
price.  There were now the same murderous riots and
scenes in Corea, though on a larger scale, that had taken
place two years before, and not only were the Japs
attacked by a Corean mob, but by Chinese soldiers
also.
</p>

<p>
A convention was afterwards signed between China
and Japan, and it was thought that peace would be
permanent, but lo! in 1894, Kim-Ok-Kim, the leader in
the awful massacres of 1884, was murdered.  The facts
are these.  After the defeat of his party he had fled to
Japan, but now he was prevailed upon to visit Shanghai
by a Corean, whose front name was Hung.  Perhaps
he would have been better hung.  But he received
great provocation from his highness Kim, for the latter
gave him a bogus cheque, for money owing, to the
tune of five thousand dollars.  Hung returned furious
and made his way to Kim's bedroom, where he found the
man who had fooled him lying down.  He shot him
twice, and on Kim springing up and rushing into the
corridor, his assassin followed and completed the job.
He then fled.
</p>

<p>
Both these men were Coreans, but till now, at all
events, Corea was considered but a portion of China,
subject to its rule and sway in every way.
</p>

<p>
Things went on from bad to worse.  Two men nagging
at each other usually come to blows, and it is the same
with nations.
</p>

<p>
Japan proposed reforms in Corea, China refused to
honour these.  Corea was shilly-shallying.  Corea
was like the fat party who sits between two stools,
and ultimately falls with legs in the air.  Japan was
discontented.  The memory of the murders rankled in
her mind, and she cared not how soon she drew the
sword and went straight for stale old China&mdash;China
the multitudinous, China the effete.
</p>

<p>
Then came an attack on the king's palace at Seoul.
</p>

<p>
While hostilities had really broken out war was not
yet officially declared.  But that lurid cloud hovering
over Corea and the seas around, was soon to burst now,
and terrible would be the results.
</p>

<p>
Next comes a brisk little naval action.  Chinese
men-of-war had been despatched to Corea, and three
of the fastest Jap cruisers had at the same time left
Sasebo.  I don't want the reader to worry over the
names of these, for though to my ear they are musical
enough they are difficult to remember.
</p>

<p>
It was not very long before the Japanese cruisers
met the two battle-ships of China, near to the island
of Phung.  (N.B.&mdash;So far as the Chinamen were concerned,
Phunk would have been a better name for it.)
</p>

<p>
Now, although the Chinese knew of the doings in
Corea and the attack on the king's palace at Seoul,
the Japanese had been at sea for several days and
didn't.  They were, therefore, much surprised to note
that the China captains did not return their salute, and
that they had really cleared for action.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if that's their game," said the commander-in-chief
of the three cruisers, "it is one that we can bear
a hand in!"
</p>

<p>
Now, I don't go in for cock-fighting&mdash;dog-fighting
is worse, and bull-fighting is terribly cruel; but I
must confess that the story of a neat little fight at
sea makes my eyes sparkle, and I rub my hands with
delight.
</p>

<p>
I sha'n't say much about this battle, however, but
the Japs tried to get the Chinamen more into open
water.  They meant business.  The former didn't like
it.  I suppose they thought the nearer to the land they
were the better.  Feather-bed sailors, you see.  So they
opened fire in a nasty, shabby kind of way.
</p>

<p>
Then at them went the Japs, hammer and tongs.
Oh, it was just too awfully lovely for anything, as the
Yankees express it.  How the guns roared!  How
viciously the fire spat out through the clouds of white
smoke!  How I wish I could have seen it!
</p>

<p>
Well, boys, in a very short time the <i>Kuang-yi</i> (China)
was <i>hors de combat</i>, and had to run ashore, and the
other battle-ship put up helm and fled to Wei-hai-Wei,
so riddled with shot that she looked like a pepper-box,
while down from her scupper-holes trickled the blood
of her wounded and slain.
</p>

<p>
But the Chinese&mdash;who are nothing if not distorters
of the truth&mdash;spread the report, or rather tried to, that
on the whole they had the best of it
</p>

<p>
It makes one laugh to read the Chinese report of
the battle, especially that yarn about killing the Jap
admiral.  He was on the bridge, says John, when he
was shot, and he leapt so high in the air that he turned
three somersaults before descending, dead.  Well, I
have seen many a Chinaman turn somersaults, but
Japanese are not so cowardly active and tricky.
</p>

<p>
But this brisk little action did not terminate here,
for it ended in a fearful tragedy, thus.  While the Jap
cruisers were chasing the Chinamen, two other ships
hove in sight.  One was a Chinese gun-boat, acting as
tender to the British S.S. <i>Kowshing</i>.  This steamer
had been chartered by the Chinese to carry troops to
Corea, and had on board about twelve hundred Chinese
officers and men, with guns, ammunition, &amp;c.  The
gun-boat was at once captured, and the <i>Kowshing</i>
overhauled.
</p>

<p>
The European officers declared their willingness to
return, but the Chinese soldiers rushed to arms.
Fools!
</p>

<p>
The commander of the Jap cruiser, <i>Naniwa</i>, ordered
the Europeans to leave.  They were not allowed to
by the Chinese.  Then after a reasonable time the
Jap cruiser ranged alongside.
</p>

<p>
Oh, it was horrible!  This great ship-load of
helpless men was to be sacrificed to the goddess of war.
</p>

<p>
Hear the roar of the great guns and the swish of
the awful torpedo!
</p>

<p>
An awful explosion follows on board the <i>Kowshing</i>,
and the vessel is enveloped in black smoke and
coal dust.  The European officers spring overboard to
swim for their lives, amidst a rain of Chinese bullets.
Again and again the guns of the <i>Naniwa</i> roll their
thunders over the sea, and in twenty minutes' time the
<i>Kowshing</i> sinks.
</p>

<p>
No less than a thousand went down in that doomed
ship.  Nor can we altogether blame the Japs, but I do
blame that British greed of gain that leads us to carry
the troops of foreign nations, and defiantly run
blockades.  No one can pity such merchantmen when they
come to grief.
</p>

<p>
The sinking of this ship probably went far to decide
the future fate of China in Corea, for had these twelve
hundred picked men, under the command of a skilful
German general, landed in Corea, it would have gone
hard with the Japs at Asar.
</p>

<p>
War was at length formally declared, and soon it
raged fast and furious.  But in almost every engagement
the Chinese, though double, sometimes even triple
in numbers, had to give way before the brave and
well-drilled Japs.
</p>

<p>
I have now to relate an adventure of a somewhat
extraordinary kind, and very sad in its way, which is
more intimately connected with our story than any
narrative of the China-Japanese war could be.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><br />
"THE BATTLE RAGES LOUD AND LONG."
</h3>

<p>
I do not really know how far the old-fashioned, out
of-date paddler <i>Osprey</i> could have gone in for
protecting British interests.  In an engagement, even with
a cowardly Chinaman, she would very soon have been
paddle-less, and a good shell would have blown her
two decks into one.
</p>

<p>
I grant all this, but the bonnie white flag with its
red jack in the corner, that floats astern even on an
unarmed man-o'-war officer's boat, is one to be
respected, and one that has made many a tyrant tremble
and pause thoughtfully, with, figuratively speaking,
his hand at his pistol-pocket.
</p>

<p>
That flag is respected wherever it waves, in battle
or in breeze.  For behind it, though unseen, lies all
the might and power of Britain.  Moral suasion is
often of more use than Gatling guns, and so here is
the <i>Osprey</i>, while around her, many times and oft,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The battle rages loud and long,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stormy winds do blow".<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
One morning early, while lying off a Chinese river,
it was necessary to send letters to some British
families&mdash;traders who, with their wives and children, desired
to be taken to a place of safety, the Chinese having
threatened their lives.
</p>

<p>
The messages sent were to assure them of protection.
They were told to hold themselves in readiness,
and that as soon as the weather moderated they would
be taken off.
</p>

<p>
Creggan was sent with this boat&mdash;the pinnace,&mdash;the
Ugly Duckling also, and Goodwin went as interpreter.
A good show of marines was also to the fore, and
these were to be left with our poor countrymen by
the river's brink.
</p>

<p>
Though the breakers ran mountains high on the
bar, there was a gap, and after a long pull and a
strong pull Creggan and his merry men got inside.
They then hugged the bank, and were at their
destination by seven bells in the forenoon watch.
</p>

<p>
They had come in time, for the Foo-kies, as our
blue-jackets used to call the Chinamen, were in swarms,
and threatening to fire the houses of the "foreign
devils".
</p>

<p>
I may state here that they afterwards did so, and
that our countrymen had to fight for their lives in a
laager, till rescued some days afterwards.
</p>

<p>
Having dispersed the cowardly mob at the bayonet
point, and received assurance from the head-man that
nothing should happen to the Europeans, Creggan
made all haste to join his ship.
</p>

<p>
They rushed the boat down-stream therefore, and
were soon at the gap.  Here great caution was necessary,
for a boiling sea was being driven in on a high
wind to fight with the quick-rolling river.
</p>

<p>
Alas! they had not gone far, ere a heavy sea struck
the port bow and dashed the boat round, broad-side
on, to the waves.  At the same time three men were
washed away and speedily sank.
</p>

<p>
The breakers rushed over them now, and almost
filled the pinnace.  To make matters worse, night had
all but fallen, despite the haste Creggan had made.
Through the mist of that turmoil of breaking water
they could just descry the lights of the <i>Osprey</i>, and
as Creggan had got the boat's head round again, hope
once more began to rise in his heart.
</p>

<p>
Alas for hope in this case!  She was speedily struck
by a huge wave, and this time turned keel uppermost.
</p>

<p>
The officers and one man managed to cling to the
upset boat, but so terrible was the war 'twixt river
and sea on this dread bar, that the boat was sometimes
keel uppermost, and sometimes right side up
but swamped.
</p>

<p>
How they struggled for life no one can ever understand
who has not been in the same fearful situation.
</p>

<p>
The sailor suddenly let go hold, and with a wild
shriek threw up his arms and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Creggan gave all up for lost.  All his young life
and loves arose before his mind's eye now, and he
prayed, as perhaps he had never prayed before, that
God in his mercy might spare them.  He soon found
that he could hold on no longer, but at that moment
a light flashed across his eyes, and a cheery hail
resounded loud over the roar of the breakers.
</p>

<p>
He knew no more until he opened his eyes and gazed
bewilderingly around.
</p>

<p>
A surgeon&mdash;Japanese&mdash;was bending over him, bathing
tenderly a wound in his temple.
</p>

<p>
"This is not the <i>Osprey</i>?" Creggan managed to
mutter.
</p>

<p>
"No; your ship had dragged her anchor, and when
nearly on the rocks got up steam in time and saved
herself by putting out to sea."
</p>

<p>
All this in perfect English.
</p>

<p>
"Pray, rest quiet," he continued; "you will be safe
and sound to-morrow.  This is our flag-ship, the
<i>Matsushima</i>."
</p>

<p>
"One word, sir; are any saved but me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; one officer&mdash;young, not handsome&mdash;and
one brave brown man.  He would not permit himself
to be saved until you and your friend were hauled on
board our boat."
</p>

<p>
How glad was Creggan next morning to meet Goodwin
and the Duck.  All were fresh, though the memory
of the terrible accident lay heavy at their hearts.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The Japanese officers were more than civil, they
were the quintessence of hospitality.  They would do all
they could for our <i>Osprey</i> heroes, but meanwhile they
were guarding a fleet of thirty transports, under the
command of Marshal Yamagata, who was proceeding
to Corea to land 10,000 men, 4500 coolies, and nearly
4000 horses.
</p>

<p>
The Chinese fleet was somewhere else similarly
engaged, and the bold Japs were hoping to meet them.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said the surgeon laughing, as he addressed
Creggan, "depend upon it, we shall give them battle
and blazes both.  You shall see how our bold iron-clad
navy can fight."
</p>

<p>
Both Creggan and his companions were delighted.
</p>

<p>
"If an engagement does take place," said the former,
"I greatly fear that we will not be able to resist the
temptation to work a gun or two."
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking," said the Jap doctor, "that as you
belong to a neutral nation, I should requisition your
services to assist me with the wounded down below."
</p>

<p>
"Too tame, doctor, too tame; I'm a Scot, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried the Jap doctor, "I have read your
splendid history, and of all your terrible struggles
against the Saxons of the south, five times your
number.  I loved your Bruce, your Wallace, ay, and even
your bold Rob Roy."
</p>

<p>
"If I may speak a word," said Goodwin, "I am
equally unwilling to do cockpit duty."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, well!" cried the bright, busy little
doctor.  "I shall address our admiral, and you all shall
fight!"
</p>

<p>
Not as long as he lives will Creggan forget that
memorable morning of September 17th, 1894.  Both
he and his true-hearted friends were up betimes.  Time
enough at all events to witness the rich and beautiful
sunrise.  The fleet, in fine order, was off Hai-Yang,
in the estuary of the Yalu river, and were now under
steam for Tahi Island, when there came a hail from
aloft which, though couched in Japanese, even Creggan
could understand.
</p>

<p>
"The Chinese fleet in sight!"
</p>

<p>
This was at 11.30.
</p>

<p>
How that shout made the pulses of every man and
officer in the flag-ship, and in every other ship, thrill
with joy&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "That stern joy which warriors feel<br />
  In foemen worthy of their steel!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Bustle and excitement followed.  Yet not to any
very great extent, for in war-time the Japs are like
the Britons, "Ready, aye ready".
</p>

<p>
Now, as far as my knowledge of the battle goes, I
think that the fleets were well matched, although the
Chinese fleet numbered two ships more (twelve against
ten).  The Japs had it somewhat in tonnage if not in
guns.
</p>

<p>
But, boys mine, do not let anyone persuade you
that because the dashing days of old have passed
away, with its ship-to-ship fights and boarding
cutlass in hand, men of heart and pluck count for
nothing.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, indeed they do.  Give me an admiral as
courageous as a lion, smart and clever, and possessed
of an eye like a Scottish eagle, with bold captains
under him ready to obey every signal, and blue-jackets
of the British type on every ship, then I
should not care if, in action, the enemy's vessels
outnumbered ours.  We should capture, sink, or burn
them,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "For England, home, and beauty".<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Chinese were well supplied with torpedo boats,
and could handle them too, but in manoeuvring they did
not show half the skill exhibited by the now
cool-headed and calculating Japs.
</p>

<p>
The battle was almost like a game of whist, owing
to the Japanese admiral's far-sightedness.  There were
also gallant fellows enough to work the signals.
</p>

<p>
The Jap fleet was divided into a flying and a main
squadron.  Admiral Ito had one disadvantage to contend
against from the first, and I trust we British will
not forget the lesson.  The ships in his two squadrons
were not of the same speed, so that the swift fliers
had to wait for the slow.
</p>

<p>
It would be impossible, without diagrams, to give a
correct notion of the evolutions.  However, I can refer
boys interested in this noble naval battle to books on
the China-Japanese war.
</p>

<p>
It was one o'clock before the two fleets approached
on deadly warfare bent.  The Chinese in a single line,
its strongest ships in the centre, which Ting the
Chinese admiral thought would have to bear the
brunt of Ito's awful onset.
</p>

<p>
The flying squadron led the Japanese van, but soon
separated and skirted the enemy's right in fine form.
</p>

<p>
The main squadron also deviated, the bold <i>Yoshino</i>
leading and bearing the brunt of a terrible fire from
the foe.  But they outflanked the Chinese thus early,
and the Chinese weaker ships, which had been placed
at each end, were skilfully riddled, and the <i>Yang-Wei</i>
was soon in flames.
</p>

<p>
Ito had meant to sweep right round the left flank
of the enemy, and the flying squadron had already
ported to do so.  But seeing two new Chinamen and
six torpedo boats coming up to join, the flying
squadron attacked these and they fled.
</p>

<p>
And now the main squadron swept past the Chinese
right, and soon had another of their ships on fire.
</p>

<p>
It will be seen how pitiable it is to have ships in
action of unequal speed, when I tell you that the
Japanese <i>Hiyei</i> had to lag behind.  She was 2200
tons, but, exposed to the Chinese line, would soon have
been sunk, had not her brave commander instead of
passing along this fearful line of fire boldly dashed
through the enemy's centre.  Fortune favours the
brave, and this vessel escaped even the torpedoes; but
alas! when she rejoined her squadron she was in flames.
She signalled to that effect, and a brave little ship,
but slow, steamed to her assistance.  Oh, the pluck of
this bold wee <i>Akaji</i>!  Mind, she was little over five
hundred tons.[<a id="chap28fn1text"></a><a href="#chap28fn1">1</a>]  She was chased by a Chinaman double
her size, her commander was killed, her steam-pipe
destroyed, still she fought like a fiend, and when her
main-mast was carried away she hoisted her flag upon
the stump.  But at last this brave wee Jap set her foe
on fire, and the duel ended.  The <i>Akaji</i> and <i>Hiyei</i>,
however, were still in great danger, and other
Chinamen took up the pursuit.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap28fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap28fn1text">1</a>] The <i>Akaji</i> has not been reckoned in line of battle,
nor the <i>Saikio Maru</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Admiral Ito ordered the flying squadron to their
assistance, and some terribly hot work ensued at 2.30
P.M.  For the Jap called the <i>Saikio Maru</i>, was catching
it very hot between two fires, while a torpedo
boat crossing her bows launched at her two torpedoes,
both missing their mark.  Down crashed the flying
squadron and turned the odds, so the three weaklings
of the Jap fleet escaped and got out of battle and
reach.
</p>

<p>
Then the two squadrons swept round the Chinamen
in opposite directions.  The two Japanese fleets have
now closed upon the foe on both sides, and
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The battle rages loud and long".<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It was then that the two flag-ships <i>Matsushima</i> and
the Chinese <i>Ting-Yuen</i> faced each other, and fought
the most fearful naval duel of modern times.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX.
<br /><br />
LIKE A BATTLE OF OLDEN TIMES.
</h3>

<p>
The fight between those two splendid battle-ships
<i>Ting-Yuen</i> of 7430 tons and the <i>Matsushima</i> of
4300 tons, was a combat that puts us in mind of some
of the battles of olden days, when chiefs met
single-handed, and before their assembled armies decided the
fate of the day.
</p>

<p>
It will be observed that the Chinese ship was fully
three thousand tons heavier than the Japanese, and
she carried more heavy guns too.
</p>

<p>
But the admiral of the latter had skill and daring
and his vessel had far greater speed, for, while the
Chinaman could only steam fourteen knots, the Jap
could do over seventeen.  She had also more quick-firing
guns, and no living thing can stand a moment
before these terrible weapons of modern naval warfare.
</p>

<p>
Creggan was stationed in one barbette&mdash;the port&mdash;and
his friend in another, while Goodwin worked a
gun not far from our hero.
</p>

<p>
I have never had a chance of interviewing my friend
the Ugly Duckling as to his feelings during their
terrible ship-to-ship engagement, but it is not long
since I talked with Creggan himself.  He describes
the battle as a fearful tempest of fire and blood.
</p>

<p>
"What were your feelings, Creggan?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"You mean," he answered, "when we ranged up to
fight the Chinese flag-ship?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he replied, "I cannot very well tell you.  For
to begin with, the <i>Matsushima</i> had already received
her baptism of blood, and I had shuddered to see men
mangled out of all shape of humanity by bursting
shells, and others borne below, leaving here a limb
and there a ghastly arm behind, the blood spurting
fountain-like over the faces and clothes of the bearers.
</p>

<p>
"It might be my turn next, and that of the brave
men who crowded the barbette.
</p>

<p>
"Was I afraid?" he continued.  "I confess I was.
It was something more than fear that took possession
of my soul.  I felt a cold terror creeping round my
heart, for I had no hopes of life.  Such terror as this
it must be that a doomed man experiences when
walking towards the scaffold with trembling limbs and
cold perspiring knees.  But I had prayer to support
me.  I do not know if you will quite understand me,
when I say that I could see far beyond the awful din
and roar and smoke of battle, see an eye above bidding
me be of good cheer, whether death should come or
not.
</p>

<p>
"Every bullet has it billet.  Yes, but a bursting
projectile in modern warfare has not one billet, but a
hundred.  The destruction some of these shells cause
cannot be grasped by anyone who has not seen it.
</p>

<p>
"But here is a curious thing.  No sooner did the
first great boom of one of our guns take place, and our
huge shell go roaring away on its mission of destruction,
than all fear and terror passed away.  I was as
exalted now, although calm, as if I had taken a great
dose of morphia, such as Dr. Grant once gave me.
</p>

<p>
"The first shot came from the foe&mdash;I mean the first
that told.  We could see from where I stood the quick,
spiteful puff of white smoke and its awful tongue of
red fire, and almost at the same time nearly every man
around me had fallen to the deck with the fearful
concussion as the Chinese projectile struck us almost
amidships.
</p>

<p>
"But now the battle raged fast and furious.  Small
though we were in comparison with the Chinaman, we
circled around, and hardly did we fire a shot which did
not tell.
</p>

<p>
"We soon had the intense satisfaction of seeing the
<i>Ting-Yuen</i> in flames.  A few more of our shots and a
torpedo would have sunk her, had not her sister ship,
the <i>Chen-Yuen</i>, come to her and stood by her.
</p>

<p>
"The Chinese flag-ship was now unable to work her
guns, but if," said Creggan, "my memory serves me
right, it was the last shell she fired which worked such
fearful havoc on board our poor ship.
</p>

<p>
"This shell was not only terrible in itself, but,
bursting near to a large heap of ammunition, it exploded
it, tearing our decks almost to pieces, and killing or
wounding about eighty of our crew.
</p>

<p>
"I myself escaped that time," he continued.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, "but you have an empty sleeve."
</p>

<p>
"True, but it was a shell from another vessel that
tore away my forearm after this.
</p>

<p>
"But poor honest Goodwin was rent in pieces.  I
marked his brave looks but a minute or two before
this, next when I saw him he formed one in that awful
heap of carnage, when arms, limbs, heads, and bodies
were huddled together, with stanchions, broken pieces
of conning-tower, all torn up like pasteboard, and the
smoke of warfare rising slowly from the bleeding mass.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well! so quick was the death, that honest
Goodwin couldn't have known what hit him.
</p>

<p>
"Meanwhile the battle raged on, and it was just an
hour after this when I had my own disaster.  I felt no
pain.  There was a bright flash of light across my
eyes, that was all; and I was advancing to assist in
training my gun, when a comrade flung himself towards
me.  I was for the moment unaware that I was
wounded, but fell fainting to the deck.
</p>

<p>
"When I recovered my senses, I was lying in the
battery with a tourniquet around my arm.  I was
shortly after removed below, and saw no more of the
fearful fight.  But I was told that at half-past three
we sank the <i>King-Yuen</i>, and after this our fleet,
which in its two divisions, had circled right round the
Chinese, causing them great confusion, hemmed them in.
</p>

<p>
"The flying squadron passed the <i>Chih-Yuen</i>, giving
her fits, turned, swept back again, and finally under
its terrible fire she heeled over and sank with all
hands.
</p>

<p>
"I may say that the carnage in our tops was fearful.
Blood spurting from the dead and dying, and rushing
in a red stream adown the masts.
</p>

<p>
"Owing to their wonderful strength and fourteen-inch
armour belts, the Chinese flag-ship and her
sister, though utterly wrecked and riddled as to
their upper works, continued to float and fight to
the end.
</p>

<p>
"The Chinamen had certainly fought well, but
shortly before sunset thought they had had enough of
it and fled.  Our flying squadron followed, peppering
them as they went, but just as gloaming was descending
on the now gray sea they were recalled, and thus
ended the ever-memorable naval battle of the Yalu
river."

<p>
This brilliant Japanese victory, reader, had a great
effect on the campaign on land.
</p>

<p>
"Even without it," says the historian, "Japan's
military superiority was so overwhelming and China's
collapse so complete, that no single event could have
altered the fortunes of the war.  But the crushing
defeat of the Chinese fleet, and the consequent
command of the sea held by the Japanese, facilitated
all their operations, and enabled them to land their
armies when and where they chose, and to conceive
bold plans of campaign, which would have been too
hazardous without such a naval supremacy."
</p>

<p>
I must refer the reader who is interested in the
subsequent triumphs of Japanese soldiers to books on
history.  And these are plentiful enough.

<p>
One day about six weeks after the fearful fight in
which Creggan had lost his forearm, the British
paddle-frigate <i>Osprey</i> hove in sight, and both our
chief hero and the Duckling, who, by the way, had
come through the fiery ordeal all safe and unscathed,
were transferred once more to their floating home.
</p>

<p>
They were both very sorry indeed to bid adieu to
the brave Japs.  Every officer was a gentleman, and
had treated them with the greatest kindness.

CHAPTER XXX.
<br /><br />
COURT-MARTIALED.
</h3>

<p>
It would be difficult indeed to say which of the
animals was most glad to welcome our heroes on
their return.
</p>

<p>
Hurricane Bob, after a rough canine salute, must go
dashing round and round the deck, to the danger of
the limbs if not the lives of the honest sailors,
flashing his white teeth and his red flag of a tongue in a
vain effort to allay his feelings.
</p>

<p>
Oscar was different, he had so much to say to his
master, who was once again soothing and petting him,
that he got great-hearted, and whined and scolded
and cried by turns.  Just like a dog, you know.
</p>

<p>
But Admiral Jacko confined his attentions almost
solely to his master, and his joy was one of fondness,
if not effusion.  He crept into the Ugly Duckling's
arms, and it was said that he really shed tears.  But
I do not quite believe that, for I am of opinion that
man is, after all, the only animal who weeps, or rather
woman is.  Yes, I have often heard of crocodiles' tears,
and what is better still, I have more than once
examined the face of one of these saurian monsters
who dwell in the marshy interior of Africa, and I
have never seen the vestige of a tear about the ugly
beast's cheeks.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps you may say I didn't go near enough.
</p>

<p>
No, catch me doing anything of the sort, because the
crocodile would have played the game of "catch me
quick".  But I have stood at a respectful distance,
and made my inspection through the telescope.
</p>

<p>
Well, I have never seen a monkey weep.
</p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
Having done her duty in Chinese waters, and heard
that the Foo-kies had been well thrashed, as indeed
they deserved to be, the good ship <i>Osprey</i> sailed once
more for Bombay.
</p>

<p>
Thence she was sent down to Zanzibar with
dispatches, and from that place to the Cape of Good
Hope again.
</p>

<p>
On boarding the flag-ship in company with poor
one-armed Creggan, his junior lieutenant, Captain
Leeward was not sorry to find that at long, long last the
"Ordered home" had arrived.
</p>

<p>
It was time; the commission had been a long one, and
the sanitary condition of the ship was not everything
that could be desired.  This was principally owing to
the millions of gigantic cockroaches that swarmed
everywhere.
</p>

<p>
There were very many other creepie-creepies on
board the <i>Osprey</i> as well as cockroaches.  Of these
latter there were two species, one the little sort, about
three-quarters of an inch in length, the other, the true
<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, two inches and a half from stem to
stern, with feelers three inches long, of immense
breadth of beam, spiked legs, and an outspread of
wing when they flew of about three inches.
</p>

<p>
Well, there were many kinds of spiders, scorpions,
earwigs, an occasional tarantula, whose bite may
produce delirium and death, and whole colonies of little
ants.  But now and then a gigantic centiped would
appear, and these are dreaded even more than are
snakes.
</p>

<p>
So on the whole, the <i>Osprey</i> at the tail end of the
commission offered a fine field for the study of natural
history.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Homeward-bound!  What joy it spreads over every
heart on board a ship, from that of the boy who helps
the cook, feeds the pets, and gets kicked about by all
hands, to the captain himself, who, if he does not say
much, cannot hide the pleasure that beams in his face
and eyes.
</p>

<p>
There is a commander in the Royal Navy (retired),
still alive while I write, who was present at the funeral
of Britain's greatest hero, Admiral Nelson.  This
officer might well be called the father of the navy, for
he is now in his hundredth year.
</p>

<p>
Well, had he come on board on Saturday night
while the <i>Osprey</i> was making her long homeward-bound
passage from the Cape to England, he would
certainly have considered himself back once more
in the dear days of old.
</p>

<p>
There certainly was not the same amount of tossing
of cans, but the main-brace was spliced by the captain's
orders, and away forward down below, around the
galley and at the fo'c's'le head, many a song was
heard, many a yarn spun, and many a heart beat high
and warm with the thoughts of home and Merrie
England.
</p>

<p>
It really appeared that the <i>Osprey</i> herself knew she
was homeward bound.
</p>

<p>
She was the sauciest of the saucy, "for an old un",
as Jack phrased it.
</p>

<p>
"The old jade!" someone would remark, as she curtseyed
to a wave, flinging the spray far over the bows;
"the old jade!  I believe she is doing it on purpose.
Whoa, lass, whoa!"
</p>

<p>
And some of the songs sung on that Saturday night
were perhaps homely enough, but every one of them
breathed of the brine and the billows.  Two verses, for
example&mdash;they were trolled by Chips the carpenter, the
hoarse old bo's'n putting in a good bass, and some of
Mother Carey's chickens piping a tenor as they dashed
from blue wave to blue wave after itinerant
white-bait&mdash;I give below:

  JACK AND HIS NANCY.<br />

  "Scarce the foul hurricane was cleared,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce winds and waves had ceased to rattle,<br />
  Ere a bold enemy appeared,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, dauntless, we prepared for battle.<br />
  And now while some lov'd friend or wife<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like lightning rush'd on ev'ry fancy,<br />
  To Providence I trusted life,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put up a prayer&mdash;and thought of Nancy.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "At last&mdash;'twas in the month of May,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crew, it being lovely weather,<br />
  At three A.M. discovered day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And England's chalky cliffs together;<br />
  At seven up Channel how we bore!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While hopes and fears rush'd on my fancy;<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to my throbbing heart press'd Nancy."<br />
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Well, that is all very well in song, but nowadays at
all events Jack doesn't get leave to jump on shore at
twelve if his ship comes in at seven.  Nor for a day
or two, or even three.  There is a clean bill of health
to be got first, and any amount of little matters and
morsels of red tape to be seen to.
</p>

<p>
But Nancy may come on board, and Jack isn't a bit
shy at such times.  Oh no, I never met a true sailor
who was.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
I have now to relate a very strange experience that
befell Creggan and his friend the Ugly Duckling.
</p>

<p>
The ship had not long lain at anchor off the Hoe,
when, after a deal of signalling from the admiral's
office, Captain Leeward, with a strange smile on his
face, came up to the place where the two young officers
stood looking over the bulwarks at the crowd of
shore-boats, and passing many a quaint and humorous
remark.
</p>

<p>
Seeing the captain, they turned and saluted at
once.
</p>

<p>
"I regret to inform you, gentlemen," said Captain
Leeward, "that you are both prisoners.  Don't be
afraid; it will be a mere formality, I am sure.
Meanwhile, I must do my duty.  You are on parole, if you
give me your word you will make no attempt to leave
the ship."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, certainly, sir.  But&mdash;may&mdash;may I ask you
what we shall be tried for?"
</p>

<p>
The captain laughed now.
</p>

<p>
"Why," he answered, "only for assisting the Japs
against an enemy with whom we are at peace.  Keep
up your hearts, boys.  I sha'n't put a sentry over you,
but just give up your sword, Lieutenant Creggan Ogg
M'Vayne, and you, young sir, your dirk, to the officer
of the watch."
</p>

<p>
I have no desire at this end of my story to describe
the formalities&mdash;solemn enough in all conscience&mdash;of
the court of inquiry.
</p>

<p>
That sword of Creggan's and the Ugly Duckling's
dirk lay side by side on the green-baize-covered table,
surrounded by officers in fullest uniform, and the two
prisoners stood between marines with fixed bayonets,
near one end of the table.
</p>

<p>
Neither of the young officers denied anything, and
when asked what he had to say in his defence, Creggan
replied:
</p>

<p>
"Nothing at all, except that I wear an empty sleeve
in commemoration of the grandest naval battle of
modern times.  But I must add that I would do the
same again, for it isn't in British human nature to
stand by with finger in mouth while battle is raging
round."
</p>

<p>
There was much grave conversation after the
prisoners had been withdrawn, and finally they were
ordered in.
</p>

<p>
"I dare say," whispered the Duckling to Creggan a
minute before this, "it will be a shooting case.
Heigh-ho! what will become of poor Jacko, and I'm sure
my sister will break her heart!"
</p>

<p>
But to their joy, when they returned looking pale
and anxious, the sword and dirk were handed back,
and they were told that they left the court without a
stain on their character.
</p>

<p>
There were positively tears in the eyes of both
young fellows as the officers shook hands with them.
</p>

<p>
The admiral of the port invited both to dinner that
evening.  He was as anxious as anybody could be to
hear a personal narrative of the great sea-fight.
</p>

<p>
I may mention here as well as elsewhere, that before
Creggan went back to his mother's house at Torquay
he received the Victoria Cross from the hands of Her
Majesty herself, and for such an honour as this I
believe the bold young fellow would have been content
to go through far more than he had done.

SAFELY HOME AT LAST.

<p>
It only remains for me to "muster by open list", as
we say in the Royal Navy.
</p>

<p>
Let me say a word or two, then, about my <i>dramatis
personæ</i>, and so clue up.
</p>

<p>
There are always a few surprises awaiting the sailor
when he returns home after a long cruise.  Jack looks
forward to these with some anxiety, as the ship is
getting nearer and still more near to the chalky cliffs
of Old England.  He thinks himself a very happy man
indeed if these surprises turn out to be pleasant ones;
which, alas! they are not always.  Some dear one,&mdash;father,
mother, wife, sister, or sweetheart, who ought
to have come out in a shore-boat to meet him, is missing.
</p>

<p>
But there are friends alongside to bear him the sad
tidings.
</p>

<p>
She is dead!  He is dead!
</p>

<p>
And poor Jack had been so expectantly happy for
days and weeks before this!  He had entirely forgotten
that there was any such thing as death in the world.
</p>

<p>
Look at his sadly bewildered face now.
</p>

<p>
"Courage, Jack, courage!" says some brave mess-mate
with a tear in his eye.  Jack returns the pressure of
the hard yet friendly hand, but&mdash;goes down below to
weep.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
As soon as the <i>Osprey</i> was paid off, and he had bade
farewell to his mess-mates, Creggan, accompanied by
his dearest friend the Ugly Duckling, took train for
Torquay.
</p>

<p>
He did not even telegraph to say he was coming.
The two arm in arm, after paying off the hansom they
had chartered, sauntered up the terraced garden and
rang the great hall bell.
</p>

<p>
Ah! but Matty herself had been watching.  A lovely
girl she was now of sweet seventeen.
</p>

<p>
The meeting of the lovers, for lovers I now may
call them, was heartfelt and cordial; but Creggan did
not venture to kiss her.
</p>

<p>
Then she spied the empty sleeve, and, girl-like, burst
into tears.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, never mind, dear!" said Creggan soothingly.
"See what it has brought me&mdash;honour and glory, and
the Victoria Cross."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Creggan, Creggan," cried Matty, "the poor
arm was worth a thousand Victoria Crosses!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it wasn't for that I got the Cross!  But how
do you come to be here, Matty?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I've been living here for months.  Just keeping
your dear mother company."
</p>

<p>
"And where is mother?"
</p>

<p>
"She has gone into the town.  She will be home soon.
You will have time to tell me quite a deal before she
comes."
</p>

<p>
The Ugly Duckling, with Admiral Jacko in full
uniform, had been standing at some little distance, but
now Creggan beckoned him forward and introduced
him.
</p>

<p>
"My dearest friend and shipmate, Matty."
</p>

<p>
The Duckling bowed, ship-shape and sailor-fashion;
so did the Admiral.
</p>

<p>
Matty was laughing now right merrily.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure," said his master, "Admiral Jacko would
make a speech if he could.  I must make one in his
stead.  Well, Miss Matty, I can't help saying what I
think, you're just about the sweetest, all-tautest little
craft I've seen since I left Venezuela, and if I were
not engaged to be married, why&mdash;I'd&mdash;I'd run my
friend aboard, cut him out, and marry you myself."
</p>

<p>
Matty bent down over Oscar to caress him, but at
the same time to hide her blushes.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm going to take Jacko inside," said the
Duckling.  "I'm sure I shall find something for him
to eat, and something to drink."
</p>

<p>
And away he marched, which was really very kind
and thoughtful of him.
</p>

<p>
Then hand in hand down through the shrubbery
and rose lawns went Creggan and Matty.  Ah!&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "There's nothing half so sweet in life<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As love's young dream".<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Creggan felt almost too happy to speak.  But he did
speak at last, and from all I know he told the old, old,
but ever new tale.
</p>

<p>
"Now tell me, Matty," he said after this, "how your
father is.  You have said my mother is well."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and dear old father too.  But he is much in
London now."
</p>

<p>
"And Willie?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that is why Daddy is in London.  Willie, you
know, stood for the borough of Blankham, and was
duly elected.  Weren't we all so happy just?  And
I've been to the strangers' gallery myself, and saw
Willie in his place.  And really he looked by far the
nicest there.  I only wonder that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She paused.
</p>

<p>
"That what, Matty?"
</p>

<p>
"That when he rose to make a speech they coughed
him down."
</p>

<p>
"Exceedingly rude!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but they did; and Willie got so red in the
face, and I thought he was going to cry.  But he just
took up his hat and was going to leave, when a
kind-faced gentleman with long white hair put a hand on
his shoulder.  I don't know what he said, but Willie
went straight back to his seat and sat down again."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"But you haven't said a word about my Daddy the
hermit, and I hope he lives."
</p>

<p>
"Not only does he live, Creggan, but he has left Skye
and his lonely island, and has come to settle down
close beside us here.  He dines with us every night."
</p>

<p>
"How delightful!"
</p>

<p>
"The minister says he is clothed and in his right
mind."
</p>

<p>
"Poor old Daddy, he always was in his right mind."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  but you should see how nicely he dresses now.
You would take him for some reverend old professor.
You will see him to-night."
</p>

<p>
"And Archie M'Lean?"
</p>

<p>
"Still in America, and I think will remain there for
years.  They say he is making money, and that he
means to come back and marry Maggie."
</p>

<p>
"What, Maggie M'Ian?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Heigh-ho!" sighed Creggan.  "I feel getting very old."
</p>

<p>
Matty laughed right merrily.  "Poor old sailor!"
she said roguishly.  "But, oh, look, here comes Daddy
himself!"  And so it was.
</p>

<p>
Matty might well have said he looked like an old
professor.  His hair was long and gray, and he was
dressed in broadcloth.  Yet there was no sign of age
about him as the glad smile of surprise brightened his
face, and he hurried up with both hands extended to
greet and welcome Creggan home.
</p>

<p>
"My own dear sailor boy!"
</p>

<p>
He could say no more just then, and like Matty took
refuge in the caresses he bestowed on Oscar.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Oscar knew him well after all these years, for
dogs never, never do forget the dear ones they love.
</p>

<p>
Need I add that the meeting betwixt Creggan and his
mother was a happy one?  Surely that is unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
The Ugly Duckling and Admiral Jacko were
declared to be prisoners for three weeks.
</p>

<p>
"But my sister, madam!" was all the former urged
against his imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
That objection was quickly set aside, for Creggan's
mother sent for her, and she joined the jolly party at
"The Pines".
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Years have gone since then.
</p>

<p>
Creggan has retired, of course.  One-armed sailors
are not considered available for active service.
</p>

<p>
But it is only a few months since our hero led
Matty to the altar, a bonnie, bonnie young bride indeed.
</p>

<p>
And the Ugly Duckling, who has also retired, having
come into some money, is now master of a beautiful
barque (clipper), and she is all his own.
</p>

<p>
He took the newly-wedded couple down the Mediterranean
on a long honeymoon.  This was all the
more jolly because the hermit himself, with Oscar and
Admiral Jacko, were of the party.
</p>

<p>
And so the story ends.
</p>

<p>
Oh no, not quite; I must let the Ugly Duckling have
the very last word.
</p>

<p>
He and Creggan were sitting together on the quarter-deck
while sailing down the blue Levant, and while
the stars, so lustreful, shone above them and were
reflected from the sea, it was in answer to a remark of
Creggan's that he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear boy," he said, "I'm going out to Venezuela
soon, and if Natina still loves me, she shall be
my bride.  For who but romantic Natina could think
of giving her heart and hand to so ugly a duckling
as poor me?"

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
